--enable-point-in-time <0|1>::

  the Point-In-Time feature, set this option to "1". To disable the Point-In-Time
  feature, set this option to "0". By default, the Point-In-Time feature is disabled.

--point-in-time-granularity <seconds>::
  Specifies the granularity of Point-In-Time backups (period in-between two

  By default, Point-In-Time granularity is set to 600 seconds (10 minutes).

--point-in-time-max-history-age <seconds>::
  Specifies the maximum history age of Point-In-Time backups (period after which
  a snapshot is discarded so it is no longer possible to restore to that point
  in time) in seconds. By default, Point-In-Time maximum history age is set to
  86400 seconds (24 hours).
