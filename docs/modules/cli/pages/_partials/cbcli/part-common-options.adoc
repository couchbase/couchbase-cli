-u::
--user <username>::
  Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-p::
--password <password>::
  Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
  given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
  non-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
  environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
