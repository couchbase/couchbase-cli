== HOST FORMATS

When specifying a host for the couchbase-cli command the following formats are expected:

* `couchbase://<addr>` or `couchbases://<addr>`
* `\http://<addr>:<port>` or `\https://<addr>:<port>`
* `<addr>:<port>`

It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> or couchbases://<addr> format
for standard installations. The other formats allow an option to take a port
number which is needed for non-default installations where the admin port has
been set up on a port other that 8091 (or 18091 for https).
