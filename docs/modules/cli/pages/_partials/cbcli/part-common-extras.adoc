-s::
--ssl::
  (Deprecated) Specifies that the connection should use SSL verification. If
  this flag is used then SSL will be used but the cluster certificate will not
  be verified by the Certificate Authority. This flag is deprecated and not
  recommended. If you wish to use SSL encryption it is recommended that you
  specify the cluster host name using either _couchbases://_ or _https://_.
  Each of these connection schemes will ensure that the connection is
  encrypted with SSL. You may then use either --no-ssl-verify or --cacert in
  order to customize how your SSL connection is set up.

--no-ssl-verify::
  Specfies that SSL verification should be used but that verifying that the
  cluster certificate is valid should be skipped. Use of this flag is not
  recommended for production environments because it does not protect the user
  from a man-in-the-middle attack.

--cacert::
  Specifies that the SSL connection should use the cacert provided when
  connecting to the cluster. This argument takes the path the certificate
  file as its value. This is the most secure way to connect to your cluster.
