--history-retention-bytes <bytes>::
  Specifies how many bytes of document history the bucket should aim to retain
  on disk. This option is valid for Couchbase buckets with Magma storage backend
  only. By default, history retention in bytes is set to 0, which means that no
  history is retained and all stale data is removed during compaction.

--history-retention-seconds <seconds>::
  Specifies how many seconds of document history the bucket should aim to retain
  on disk. This option is valid for Couchbase buckets with Magma storage backend
  only. By default, history retention in seconds is set to 0, which means that
  no history is retained and all stale data is removed during compaction.

--enable-history-retention-by-default <0|1>::
  Specifies whether or not the document history retention should be enabled by
  default for new collections in this bucket. This option is valid for Couchbase
  buckets with Magma storage backend only. To enable the document history
  retention for new collections, set this option to "1". To disable the document
  history retention for new collections, set this option to "0". By default, the
  document history retention for new collections is enabled. To create a
  collection with a non-default history retention setting use the *collection-manage*
  command with *--enable-history* flag set to either "0" or "1".
