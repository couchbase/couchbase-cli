cbbackupwrapper -
endif::[]
(Deprecated) A wrapper around `cbbackup` that was made to improve performance for
enterprise users. Superseded by `cbbackupmgr`, which should be used
instead of this tool.

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
_cbbackupwrapper_ [--username <user>] [--password <password>] [--ssl]
                  [--bucket-source <name>] [--single-node]
                  [--mode <full|diff|accu>] [--path <path>] [--port <port>]
                  [--number <num>] [--parallelism <num>] [--verbose]
                  [--extra <options>] [--help] cluster backup_dir

== DESCRIPTION

DEPRECATION WARNING: This tool has been deprecated please use cbbackupmgr instead.

`cbbackupwrapper` divides the vBuckets between various `cbbackup` processes to
improve performance.

The directory structure is not compatible with `cbbackup` or `cbrestore` thus
incremental have to be made with `cbbackupwrapper` and restores have to be
performed with `cbrestorewrapper`. The resulting directory structure after
performing a successful backup with `cbbackupwrapper` will look as follows:

    ├── 0-99
    │   └── 2019-06-26T151213Z
    │       └── 2019-06-26T151213Z-full
    │           └── bucket-beer-sample
    │               ├── design.json
    │               └── node-10.112.193.101%3A8091
    ├── 100-199

    │               ├── design.json

    └── logs


The structure contains a folder for every `n` vBuckets where `n` is the
parameter `number` in the command. Inside each vBucket folder we have a backup
directory containing the data for those vBuckets. Finally we have a log folder
that contains the output of each `cbbackup` process used to create each vBucket
folder.

== Options

-u,--username <user>::
  Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-p,--password <password>::
  Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-s,--ssl::
  (Deprecated) Specifies that the connection should use SSL verification. If
  this flag is used then SSL will be used but the cluster certificate will not
  be verified by the Certificate Authority. This flag is deprecated and not
  recommended. If you wish to use SSL encryption it is recommended that you
  specify the cluster host name using either _couchbases://_ or _https://_.
  Each of these connection schemes will ensure that the connection is
  encrypted with SSL. You may then use either --no-ssl-verify or --cacert in
  order to customize how your SSL connection is set up.

-b,--bucket-source <bucket>::
  Single named bucket from source cluster to transfer. If the backup directory
  only contains a single bucket, then that bucket is automatically used.

--single-node::
  Transfer data only from the source data node.

-m,--mode <full|diff|accu>::
  Select the backup mode, the available options are: `full`, `diff`, `accu`.
  If an option is not provided it defaults to `diff`. The `full` mode will
  perform a full backup. The `diff` mode will perform a differential
  incremental backup which backups only the changes since the last full or
  incremental backup. The `accu` mode performs a cumulative incremental backup,
  which backs up all changes since the last full backup.

--path <path>::
  Specifies the path to the `cbbackup` executable. Defaults to the current
  directory.

--port <port>::
  Specifies the bucket port. Defaults to 11210

-n,--number <num>::
  Specify the number of vBuckets per process. Defaults to 100

-p,--parallelism <num>::
  Number of vBucket backup jobs to run at a time. Defaults to 1.

-v,--verbose::
  Verbose logging; more -v's provide more verbosity. Max is -vvv

-x,--extra <options>::
  Provide extra, uncommon configuration parameters. Comma-separated
  key=val pairs

== EXTRAS

The following are extra, specialized command options with the `cbbackupwrapper -x` parameter.

.cbbackupwrapper -x options
[cols="100,223"]
|===
| -x options | Description

| `backoff_cap=10`
| Maximum backoff time during the rebalance period.

| `batch_max_bytes=400000`
| Transfer this # of bytes per batch.

| `batch_max_size=1000`
| Transfer this # of documents per batch.

| `cbb_max_mb=100000`
| Split backup file on destination cluster if it exceeds the MiB.

| `conflict_resolve=1`
| By default, disable conflict resolution.

This option doesn't work in Couchbase Server versions 4.0 and 4.1 but will be
re-implemented in version 4.1.1 and in subsequent versions.

| `data_only=0`
| For value 1, transfer only data from a backup file or cluster.

| `design_doc_only=0`
| For value 1, transfer only design documents from a backup file or cluster.
Default: 0.

Back up only design documents which include view and secondary index
definitions from a cluster or bucket with the option `design_doc_only=1`.
Restore only design documents with `cbrestore -x design_doc_only=1`.

| `max_retry=10`
| Max number of sequential retries if the transfer fails.

| `mcd_compatible=1`
| For value 0, display extended fields for stdout output.

| `nmv_retry=1`
| 0 or 1, where 1 retries transfer after a NOT_MY_VBUCKET message.
Default: 1.

| `recv_min_bytes=4096`
| Amount of bytes for every TCP/IP batch transferred.

| `rehash=0`
| For value 1, rehash the partition id's of each item.
This is required when transferring data between clusters with different number
of partitions, such as when transferring data from an Mac OS X server to a
non-Mac OS X cluster.

| `report=5`
| Number batches transferred before updating progress bar in console.

| `report_full=2000`
| Number batches transferred before emitting progress information in console.

| `seqno=0`
| By default, start seqno from beginning.

| `try_xwm=1`
| Transfer documents with metadata.
Default: 1.
Value of 0 is only used when transferring from 1.8.x to 1.8.x.

| `uncompress=0`
| For value 1, restore data in uncompressed mode.

This option is unsupported.
To create backups with compression, use `cbbackupmgr`, which is available for
Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition only.
See xref:backup-restore:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc[Backup].

== EXAMPLE

To perform a backup with `cbbackupwrapper` run:

    $ cbbackupwrapper http://10.112.193.101:8091 ~/backups \
      -u Administrator -p password
