== DESCRIPTION

DEPRECATION WARNING: This tool has been deprecated please use cbbackupmgr instead.

This tool restores data that was backed up using `cbbackup` the command will
take some options as well as the `backup_dir` which is the path to the folder
created by `cbbackup` that has to be restored and the `destination` which is
the target cluster. The target cluster can be the same cluster from which
the data was backed up or a different one. The tool does not create buckets so
the buckets must exist in the target cluster.


*Conflict Resolution*

By default, when restoring from a backup using `cbrestore`, Couchbase Server will
perform conflict resolution on all documents to be restored. The conflict
resolution behavior is the same as cross data center replication (XDCR), which
is detailed in Availability. This is so that documents which have been updated
after the backup are not incorrectly overwritten by the restore process.
As a result, after running the restore process, some documents may not match
the content of the backup file. In certain cases where a document has been
recently deleted on the cluster, the document may not be restored at all due
to this conflict resolution. To restore the contents of a backup while
overwriting current documents with the same key, pass the extra parameter
`conflict_resolve=0` as part of the `cbrestore` command. To ensure that only
the documents contained in the backup exist in the bucket after performing the
restore, flush the bucket prior to performing the restore.


The tool can be found in the following directories:
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Operating system | Location

| Linux
| `/opt/couchbase/bin/cbrestore`

| Windows
| `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbrestore`

| Mac OS X
| `/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbrestore`
|===

== Options

-u,--username <user>::
  Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-p,--password <password>::
  Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-s,--ssl::
  (Deprecated) Specifies that the connection should use SSL verification. If
  this flag is used then SSL will be used but the cluster certificate will not
  be verified by the Certificate Authority. This flag is deprecated and not
  recommended. If you wish to use SSL encryption it is recommended that you
  specify the cluster host name using either _couchbases://_ or _https://_.
  Each of these connection schemes will ensure that the connection is
  encrypted with SSL. You may then use either --no-ssl-verify or --cacert in
  order to customize how your SSL connection is set up.

--no-ssl-verify::
  Specifies that SSL verification should be used but that verifying that the
  cluster certificate is valid should be skipped. Use of this flag is not
  recommended for production environments because it does not protect the user
  from a man-in-the-middle attack.

--cacert <path>::
  Specifies that the SSL connection should use the cacert provided when
  connecting to the cluster. This argument takes the path the certificate
  file as its value. This is the most secure way to connect to your cluster.

-b,--bucket-source <bucket>::
  Single named bucket from source cluster to transfer. If the backup directory
  only contains a single bucket, then that bucket is automatically used.

-B,--bucket-destination <bucket>::
  Specify the bucket to restore the data to in the target cluster. If not
  provided it will default to match the `--bucket-source`.

-i,--id <vbid>::
  Transfer only items that match a vBucket ID.

-k,--key <regexp>::
  Transfer only items with keys that match the given regular expression.

--from-date <start>::
  Restore data from the first specified backup in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`*. By
  default the starting point will be the first backup.

--to-date <end>::
  Restore data until the date specified as `yyyy-mm-dd`*. By default, all data
  collected is restored.

-a,--add::
  Used to not override the existing items in the destination.

-n,--dry-run::
  When specified the tool will not transfer data but only validate
  parameters, files, connectivity and configuration.

-v,--verbose::
  Verbose logging; more -v's provide more verbosity. Max is -vvv

--silent::
  Reduces the logging verbosity to only include errors.

-t,--threads <num>::
  Number of concurrent worker threads performing transfer, defaults to 1.

-x,--extra <options>::
  Provide extra, uncommon configuration parameters. Comma-separated
  key=val pairs

== EXTRAS

The following are extra, specialized command options with the `cbbackup -x` parameter.

.cbbackup -x options
[cols="100,223"]
|===
| -x options | Description

| `backoff_cap=10`
| Maximum backoff time during the rebalance period.

| `batch_max_bytes=400000`
| Transfer this # of bytes per batch.

| `batch_max_size=1000`
| Transfer this # of documents per batch.

| `cbb_max_mb=100000`
| Split backup file on destination cluster if it exceeds the MiB.

| `conflict_resolve=1`
| By default, disable conflict resolution.

This option doesn't work in Couchbase Server versions 4.0 and 4.1 but will be
re-implemented in version 4.1.1 and in subsequent versions.

| `data_only=0`
| For value 1, transfer only data from a backup file or cluster.

| `design_doc_only=0`
| For value 1, transfer only design documents from a backup file or cluster.
Default: 0.

Back up only design documents which include view and secondary index
definitions from a cluster or bucket with the option `design_doc_only=1`.
Restore only design documents with `cbrestore -x design_doc_only=1`.

| `max_retry=10`
| Max number of sequential retries if the transfer fails.

| `mcd_compatible=1`
| For value 0, display extended fields for stdout output.

| `nmv_retry=1`
| 0 or 1, where 1 retries transfer after a NOT_MY_VBUCKET message.
Default: 1.

| `recv_min_bytes=4096`
| Amount of bytes for every TCP/IP batch transferred.

| `rehash=0`
| For value 1, rehash the partition id's of each item.
This is required when transferring data between clusters with different number
of partitions, such as when transferring data from an Mac OS X server to a
non-Mac OS X cluster.

| `report=5`
| Number batches transferred before updating progress bar in console.

| `report_full=2000`
| Number batches transferred before emitting progress information in console.

| `seqno=0`
| By default, start from sequence number 0.

| `try_xwm=1`
| Transfer documents with metadata.
Default: 1.
Value of 0 is only used when transferring from 1.8.x to 1.8.x.

| `uncompress=0`
| For value 1, restore data in uncompressed mode.

This option is unsupported.
To create backups with compression, use `cbbackupmgr`, which is available for
Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition only.
See xref:backup-restore:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc[Backup].

== EXAMPLES

The most basic operation is to restore all the backed in our backup directory
`~/backups`. The directory will have a format as the one bellow:

    backups
    └── 2019-06-25T141453Z
        ├── 2019-06-25T141453Z-full
        │   └── bucket-beer-sample
        └── 2019-06-25T141553Z-diff
            └── bucket-beer-sample

To restore we use the command bellow. Note that `cbrestore` does not create
the buckets in the target cluster so in this case our cluster already has
a bucket named `beer-sample`.

    $ cbrestore ~/backups http://10.112.193.101:8091 -u Administrator \
      -p password

When executed the command will restore all the data in the `~/backups`
directory into the target cluster, if any of the buckets in the backup do not
exist in the target cluster `cbrestore` will return an error. We can restore
one bucket to a different bucket using the `-b` and `-B` flags as follows.

    $ cbrestore ~/backups http://10.112.193.101:8091 -u Administrator \
      -p password -b beer-sample -B new-bucket

This will restore the backed up data for beer-sample into the bucket
`new-bucket` in the target cluster. If the backup contains multiple buckets
we can restore only one by using the `-b` flag.

The restore also has the ability to select only a subset of the backups to be
restored. If the backup directory contained 4 backup such as:

    backups
    └── 2019-06-25T141453Z
        ├── 2019-06-25T141453Z-full
        │   └── bucket-beer-sample
        ├── 2019-06-26T141553Z-diff
        │    └── bucket-beer-sample
        ├── 2019-06-27T151453Z-full
        │   └── bucket-beer-sample
        └── 2019-06-28T161553Z-diff
            └── bucket-beer-sample

Then we can restore only the first two by using the following command:

    $ cbrestore ~/backups http://10.112.193.101:8091 -u Administrator \
      -p password -b beer-sample --from-date 2019-06-25 --to-date 2019-06-27

The tool also gives the capability of filtering documents based on keys, giving
a regular expression to the `-k` flag will result in only documents that have
 keys that match the expression being restored. An example can be sen bellow

     $ cbrestore ~/backups http://10.112.193.101:8091 -u Administrator \
      -p password -b default --k '^user:.*'

The command above will only restore documents with keys that have the prefix
'user:'.
