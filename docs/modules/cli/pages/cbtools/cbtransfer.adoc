== DESCRIPTION

DEPRECATION WARNING: This tool has been deprecated please use cbdatarecovery instead.

The `cbtransfer` tool is a generic tool for transferring data from various
types of source to various types of sinks. Both `cbbackup` and `cbrestore`
are built upon this tool. The `cbbackup` tool is a transfer from a Couchbase
Server source to a backup directory sink, and `cbrestore` is the opposite.

The tool is a lightweight extract-transform-load (ETL) tool that transfers
data between clusters and to and from files. The source and destination
parameters are similar to URLs or file paths.

The tool is at the following location:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Operating system | Location

| Linux
| [.path]_/opt/couchbase/bin/_

| Windows
| [.path]_C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\_

| Mac OS X
| [.path]_/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/_
|===

The supported sources are:

    - Couchbase Server
    - Backup directory (made by `cbbackup`)
    - CSV files that where made by `cbtransfer`
    - Couchstore files

The supported sinks are:

    - Couchbase Server
    - Backup directory (same format as `cbbackup`)
    - CSV (the format of the CSV is unique to Couchbase and can not be changed)
    - Couchstore files
    - Standard out

Although `cbtransfer` can transfer from and to backup directories it is
recommended that `cbbackup` and `cbrestore` are used for that purpose.

== Options

-u,--username <user>::
  Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-p,--password <password>::
  Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-s,--ssl::
  (Deprecated) Specifies that the connection should use SSL verification. If
  this flag is used then SSL will be used but the cluster certificate will not
  be verified by the Certificate Authority. This flag is deprecated and not
  recommended. If you wish to use SSL encryption it is recommended that you
  specify the cluster host name using either _couchbases://_ or _https://_.
  Each of these connection schemes will ensure that the connection is
  encrypted with SSL. You may then use either --no-ssl-verify or --cacert in
  order to customize how your SSL connection is set up.

--no-ssl-verify::
  Specifies that SSL verification should be used but that verifying that the
  cluster certificate is valid should be skipped. Use of this flag is not
  recommended for production environments because it does not protect the user
  from a man-in-the-middle attack.

--cacert <path>::
  Specifies that the SSL connection should use the cacert provided when
  connecting to the cluster. This argument takes the path the certificate
  file as its value. This is the most secure way to connect to your cluster.

-U,--username-dest <user>::
  Specifies the username of the destination cluster, when transferring from one
  cluster to another.

-P,--password-dest <password>::
  Specifies the password of the destination cluster, when transferring from one
  cluster to another.

-b,--bucket-source <bucket>::
  Single named bucket from a source cluster to transfer.

-B,--bucket-destination <bucket>::
  Single named bucket on the destination cluster that receives the transfer.
  You can transfer to a bucket with a different name than your source bucket;
  if you do not provide a name, it defaults to the same name as the
  bucket-source.

-i,--id <vbid>::
  Transfer only items that match a vBucket ID.

-k,--key <regexp>::
  Transfer only items with keys that match the given regular expression.

--single-node::
  Transfer from a single server node in a source cluster. This single server
  node is a source node URL.

--source-vbucket-state <active|replica>::
  Only transfer from the source vBuckets occurs in this state, such as `active`
  (default) or `replica`. Must be used with the Couchbase cluster as a source.

--destination-vbucket-state <active|replica>::
  Only transfer to destination vBuckets in this state, such as `active`
  (default) or `replica`. Must be used with the Couchbase cluster as a
  destination.

--destination-operation <set|add|get>::
  Perform this operation on transfer. Set will override an existing document;
  add will not override; get will load all keys transferred from a source
  cluster into the caching layer at the destination.

-n,--dry-run::
  When specified the tool will not transfer data but only validate
  parameters, files, connectivity and configuration.

-v,--verbose::
  Verbose logging; more -v's provide more verbosity. Max is -vvv

--silent::
  Reduces the logging verbosity to only include errors.

-t,--threads <num>::
  Number of concurrent worker threads performing transfer, defaults to 1.

-x,--extra <options>::
  Provide extra, uncommon configuration parameters. Comma-separated
  key=val pairs

== EXTRAS

The following are extra, specialized command options with the `cbtransfer -x` parameter.

.cbtransfer -x options
[cols="100,223"]
|===
| -x options | Description

| `backoff_cap=10`
| Maximum backoff time during the rebalance period.

| `batch_max_bytes=400000`
| Transfer this # of bytes per batch.

| `batch_max_size=1000`
| Transfer this # of documents per batch.

| `cbb_max_mb=100000`
| Split backup file on destination cluster if it exceeds the MiB.

| `conflict_resolve=1`
| By default, disable conflict resolution.

This option doesn't work in Couchbase Server versions 4.0 and 4.1 but will be
re-implemented in version 4.1.1 and in subsequent versions.

| `data_only=0`
| For value 1, transfer only data from a backup file or cluster.

| `design_doc_only=0`
| For value 1, transfer only design documents from a backup file or cluster.
Default: 0.

Back up only design documents which include view and secondary index
definitions from a cluster or bucket with the option `design_doc_only=1`.
Restore only design documents with `cbrestore -x design_doc_only=1`.

| `max_retry=10`
| Max number of sequential retries if the transfer fails.

| `mcd_compatible=1`
| For value 0, display extended fields for stdout output.

| `nmv_retry=1`
| 0 or 1, where 1 retries transfer after a NOT_MY_VBUCKET message.
Default: 1.

| `recv_min_bytes=4096`
| Amount of bytes for every TCP/IP batch transferred.

| `rehash=0`
| For value 1, rehash the partition id's of each item.
This is required when transferring data between clusters with different number
of partitions, such as when transferring data from an Mac OS X server to a
non-Mac OS X cluster.

| `report=5`
| Number batches transferred before updating progress bar in console.

| `report_full=2000`
| Number batches transferred before emitting progress information in console.

| `seqno=0`
| By default, start seqno from beginning.

| `try_xwm=1`
| Transfer documents with metadata.
Default: 1.
Value of 0 is only used when transferring from 1.8.x to 1.8.x.

| `uncompress=0`
| For value 1, restore data in uncompressed mode.

This option is unsupported.
To create backups with compression, use `cbbackupmgr`, which is available for
Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition only.
See xref:backup-restore:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc[Backup].

== EXAMPLES

*Transferring node to node*

If a node is not running but we wish to transfer the documents stored in it to
another cluster we can do so by transferring the contents of the couchstore
files to the destination cluster. This can be done with the command bellow:
----
$ cbtransfer couchstore-files:///opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data \
 http://10.5.3.121:8091 -u Administrator -p password -b source_bucket \
 -B dest_bucket
----
The command above will transfer the documents in the bucket `source_bucket`
to the bucket `dest_bucket` in the target cluster.

It is also possible to transfer from a running cluster to another cluster using
the command bellow:
----
$ cbtransfer http://localhost:8091 http://10.5.3.121:8091 \
 -u Administrator -p password -U Administrator -P password
----
This command will transfer all data from one cluster to another, is it possible
to only select one bucket using the `-b` and `-B` flags. Although `cbtransfer`
has the ability to transfer from one running node to another it is recommended
to use XDCR where possible for this purpose.

*Transferring to and from csv*

The `cbtransfer` tool is also used to import and export csv files. Data is
imported into Couchbase Server as documents and documents are exported from the
server into comma-separated values. Design documents associated with vBuckets
are not included.

To export the bucket `beer-sample` from our node to csv use the command bellow:
----
$ cbtransfer http://127.0.0.1:8091  csv:///export/out.csv \
 -u Administrator -p password -b beer-sample
----
This will create a file named `out_beer-sample_127.0.0.1%38091.csv` the file
name is a combination of the provided file name in the command, the source
bucket and the source node.

The resulting file will have the following format (Note that the value is
stored as a Python bytes object):
----
id,flags,expiration,cas,value,rev,vbid,dtype
scotch_ale_2001,33554432,0,1561466789199544320,"b'{""abv"":11.1,""type"":""beer""}'",b'\x00\x00\x00\x01',0,1
1084_barleywine,33554432,0,1561466789204197376,"b'{""abv"":0.0,""type"":""beer""}'",b'\x00\x00\x00\x01',0,1
----

The csv can then be imported using the following command:
----
$ cbtransfer /export/out_beer-sample_127.0.0.1%3A8091.csv http://localhost:8091 \
 -u Administrator -p asdasd -B beer-sample
----
`cbtransfer` can only restore files that where generated by the same version of
`cbtransfer`, if a file that was not generated by the tool is given it will
fail.

*Transferring to stdout*

For testing you can output to standard out to do so specify the destination to
be `stdout:` as in the example bellow.
----
$ cbtransfer http://localhost:8091 stdout: \
 -u Administrator -p password
----
This will give the following output:
----
set b'pymc0' 0 0 62
{"name": "pymc0", "age": 0, "index": "0", "body":"0000000000"}
set b'pymc1' 0 0 62
{"name": "pymc1", "age": 1, "index": "1", "body":"0000000000"}
set b'pymc3' 0 0 62
{"name": "pymc3", "age": 3, "index": "3", "body":"0000000000"}
set b'pymc2' 0 0 62
{"name": "pymc2", "age": 2, "index": "2", "body":"0000000000"}
----
