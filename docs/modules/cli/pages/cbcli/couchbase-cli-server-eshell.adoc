couchbase-cli-server-eshell -
endif::[]
Opens a shell to talk to the cluster manager process

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
_couchbase-cli server-eshell_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
    [--password <password>] [--vm <vm_name>] [--erl <path>]

== DESCRIPTION

This is a hidden command and is not intended for typical production use. This
command allows the user to connect to the cluster manager process in order to
make unsupported changes in the cluster manager. This command is typically used
as last resort in order to address uncommon production issues. Check with the
Couchbase Support team before running this command because improper use can lead
to the cluster being placed in an unusable state.

When this command is executed it connects to the cluster manager process
specified and starts a shell so that the user can interact with the cluster
manager.

== OPTIONS

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-common-options.adoc[]

--vm::
  The part of the cluster manager to connect to. This option can either be set
  to babysitter, couchdb, or ns_server. The babysitter vm is a monitor that
  ensures the cluster manager is always running and is restarted in the event
  of a crash or error. The couchdb vm runs the views service on each data node
  and the ns_server vm corresponds to the cluster manager. By default the vm
  option is set to ns_server.

--erl::
  Specified the location of the erlang process. This parameter should be set
  if the default erlang process that is shipped with Couchbase is not the
  correct executable to connect to the cluster manager with.

== EXAMPLES

To connect to the cluster manager process you can run the following command
below.

  $ couchbase-cli server-eshell -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
   --password password

  Erlang R16B03-1 (erts-5.10.4.0.0.1)

  Eshell V5.10.4.0.0.1  (abort with ^G)
  (n_0@192.168.1.5)1>

When the command is executed it will bring up a shell that is connected to the
vm specified in the command. Since the --vm parameter is not specified we
connect to the default ns_server vm.

To connect to the babysitter vm the following command would be run.

  $ couchbase-cli server-eshell -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
   --password password --vm babysitter

  Erlang R16B03-1 (erts-5.10.4.0.0.1)

  Eshell V5.10.4.0.0.1  (abort with ^G)
  (n_0@192.168.1.5)1>

To exit the shell send the SIGINT signal. This can be done by typing Ctrl-C.
