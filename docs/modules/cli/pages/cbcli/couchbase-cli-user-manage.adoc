== DESCRIPTION

This command allows administrators to assign and manage roles to different users
and user groups in their organization. Users can either be managed locally by
Couchbase or externally through the use of an external domain.

== OPTIONS

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-common-options.adoc[]

--delete::
  Deletes an RBAC user profile from the cluster. You must have full
  administrator privileges in order to delete a user profile.

--list::
  Lists all RBAC user profiles in the cluster and show their roles. You must
  have full administrator privileges in order to list all user profiles.

--my-roles::
  Shows the current users RBAC user profile.

--set::
  Creates or updates an RBAC user profile. You must have full administrator
  privileges in order to create or update a user profile.

--get::
  Retrieves the RBAC user specified by --rbac-username and show their roles.

--set-group::
  Creates or updates a user group.

--delete-group::
  Deletes a user group.

--list-groups::
  List all groups.

--get-group::
  Gets the details of a group.

--rbac-username <username>::
  Specifies the username of the RBAC user to modify. This option is used when
  deleting, creating, or updating an RBAC user profile.

--rbac-password <password>::
  Specifies the password to be used for an RBAC user profile. This option is
  used only when creating or updating a _local_ RBAC user profile. Couchbase
  does not store password for _external_ RBAC roles.

--rbac-name <name>::
  Specifies the name to be used for an RBAC user profile. This option is used
  when creating or updating an RBAC user profile and it is recommended that
  this option be set to the users full name.

--roles <roles_list>::
  Specifies the roles to be given to an RBAC user profile. This option is used
  when creating or updating an RBAC user profile and it is specified as a
  comma separated list of roles. See the ROLES section for more details on the
  available roles in Couchbase.

--auth-domain <domain>::
  Specifies the auth_domain to use for a RBAC user profile. This option is
  used when deleting, creating or updating a RBAC user profile and it may be
  set to either _local_ or _external_. Local users are users that are managed
  directly by the Couchbase cluster. External users are users managed by an
  external source such as LDAP.

--user-groups <groups>::
  Specifies the groups the user should be added to. This is used when creating
  a user (--set) or when updating the users group, and
  should be specified as a comma separated list.

--group-name <group>::
  Specifies the target group for the group operations (--set-group,
  --delete-group, --get-group).

--group-description <text>::
  Specifies the group description, it is used with --set-group.

--ldap-ref <ref>::
  Specifies the LDAP group's distinguished name, to link the couchbase group
  with the LDAP one.
