Manage collections and scopes in a bucket

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
_couchbase-cli collection-manage_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
    [--password <password>] [--client-cert <path>] [--client-cert-password <password>]
    [--client-key <path>] [--client-key-password <password>] [--bucket <bucket>]
    [--create-scope <scope>] [--drop-scope <scope>] [--list-scopes]
    [--create-collection <collection>] [--drop-collection <collection>]
    [--list-collections [<scope_list>]] [--max-ttl <seconds>]

== DESCRIPTION

This command is used to manage collections and scopes in a bucket.
Collections allow the user to categorize the data in the bucket
by creating collections and specifying a collection when adding
documents to a bucket. Scopes are the grouping of collections,
which allows further categorization and ease of management.

The following rules define a valid collection or scope name:

* Must be between 1 and 30 bytes long
* Can only contain characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and the following
symbols _ - %
* Cannot start with _ or %

Only Couchbase and Ephemeral bucket has Collection support.

== OPTIONS

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-common-options.adoc[]

--bucket <bucket>::
  The name of the bucket.

--create-scope <scope>::
  Makes a scope in the bucket with the name provided.

--drop-scope <scope>::
  Removes the scope from the bucket with the name provided.

--list-scopes::
  Shows all scopes in the bucket.

--create-collection <collection>::
  Makes the collection in the scope. The option takes a path in dot
  format (scope.collection), specifying the scope in which the
  collection and the name to be created.

--drop-collection <collection>::
  Removes the collection from the scope. The option takes a path in
  dot format (scope.collection), specifying the scope from which
  the collection and collection-name are to be removed.

--list-collections [<scope_list>]::
  Takes an optional comma separated list of scope names. It will show all the
  collections inside those scopes. If no scopes are provided it will show all the
  collections.

--max-ttl <seconds>::
  Specifies the maximum TTL (time-to-live) for all documents in the
  collection, in seconds. If enabled and a document is mutated with
  no TTL or a TTL greater than than the maximum, its TTL will be set
  to the maximum TTL. Setting this option to 0 disables the use of
  max-TTL, and the largest TTL that is allowed is 2147483647.
