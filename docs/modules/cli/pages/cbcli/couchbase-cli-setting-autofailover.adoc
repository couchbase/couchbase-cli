couchbase-cli-setting-autofailover -
endif::[]
Modifies auto-failover settings

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
_couchbase-cli setting-autofailover_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
    [--password <password>] [--enable-auto-failover <num>]
    [--auto-failover-timeout <seconds>]

== DESCRIPTION

Auto-failover allows unresponsive servers to be failed over automatically by the
cluster manager. Data paritions in Couchbase are always served from a single
master node. As a result if a server is down in the cluster data from that
server will be not be available while that server is down. The server will
either need to be manually or automatically failed over in order to promote
replica data partitions on replica servers to active data partitions so that
they can be accessed by the application.

Since the administrator will not always be able to manually fail servers over
quickly enough to avoid application down time Couchbase provides an
auto-failover feature. This feature allows the cluster manager to automatically
fail over down nodes over and bring the cluster back to a healthy state as
quickly as possible.

== OPTIONS

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-common-options.adoc[]

--enable-auto-failover <num>::
  Specifies whether or not autofailover is enabled. Set this option to "1" to
  enable autofailover or "0" to disable autofailover.

--auto-failover-timeout <seconds>::
  Specifies the auto-failover timeout. This is the amount of time a node must
  be unresponsive before the cluster manager considers the node to be down and
  fails it over. The minimum auto-failover timeout is 30 seconds in Couchbase
  Community Edition and 5 seconds in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.

To enable autofailover with a 120 second auto-failover timeout run the following
command.

  $ couchbase-cli setting-autofailover -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
   --password password --enable-auto-failover 1 --auto-failover-timeout 120

To disable autofailover run the following
