couchbase-cli-recovery -

Recovers a previously failed over node

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
_couchbase-cli recovery_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <username>]
    [--password <password>] [--server-recovery <servers>]
    [--recovery-type <type>]

== DESCRIPTION

When a server is failed over and removed from the cluster it may only be able to
be added back to the cluster. And example of this is when a server loses power.
This server might get failed over and removed from the cluster, but once power
is restored to the server you may want to add it back to the cluster.

Another use case is taking a server out of the cluster for maintainance. This
is done by gracefully failing over a server to ensure there is no data loss.
The administrator can then perform mainainance on the removed server and add it
back with the server-readd command.

The recovery command also allows a server to have it's data remvoed before being
added back to the cluster (full recovery) or having the server resume from where
it last left off (delta recovery). Delta recovery will always take the least
amount of time and is the recommended recovery mode.

Note that after the recovery subcommand is run you must rebalance the
cluster. See the man:couchbase-cli-rebalance[1] command for more information
on rebalancing a cluster.

== OPTIONS

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-common-options.adoc[]

--server-recovery <servers>::
  A command separated list of servers to recover. The each server should
  correspond to the hostname or IP address of a server to be added back to
  the cluster.

--recovery-type <type>::
  Specifies whether or not we should do full or delta recovery of data on the
  servers being added back. Full recover means that all data on the servers
  being recovered will be removed and we will recover all data. Specifying
  delta recover means we will keep the data that is on each server and only
  recover the data that each server doesn't have. To specify full recovery set
  this option to "full". For delta recovery set this option to "delta". The
  default value for this option is "full".

== EXAMPLES

If we have a server at 192.168.1.6:8091 that we want to recover and we want to
recover data using delta recovery then we can run the following command.

  $ couchbase-cli server-readd -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
   --password password --server-recovery 192.168.1.6:8091 \
   --recovery-type delta

If we need to recover multiple servers then we would run the following command.

  $ couchbase-cli server-readd -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
   --password password --server-recovery 192.168.1.6:8091,192.168.1.7:8091 \
   --recovery-type delta

If we wanted the servers being recovered to use full recovery then we would run
the following command.

  $ couchbase-cli server-readd -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
   --password password --server-recovery 192.168.1.6:8091 \
   --recovery-type full
