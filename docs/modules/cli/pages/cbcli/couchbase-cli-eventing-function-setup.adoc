This command is used to manage functions in the Event service

== OPTIONS

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-common-options.adoc[]

--import::
  Import function(s) from a file. This option requires --file to be
  specified. The file provided should be from the --export option.

--export::
  Export a named function to a file. This option requires --file and
  --name to be specified.

--export-all::
  Export all functions to a file. This option requires --file to be
  specified.

--delete::
  Deletes a named function. Functions can only be deleted when in the
  undeployed state. This option requires --name to be specified.

--list::
  List all functions.

--deploy::
  Deploys the named function. This option requires --name to be specified,
  as well as --bucket and --scope for collection-aware functions.

--undeploy::
  Undeploys the named function. This option requires --name to be specified,
  as well as --bucket and --scope for collection-aware functions.

--pause::
  Pause the named function. This option requires --name to be specified, as
  well as --bucket and --scope for collection-aware functions. See the PAUSE
  VS UNDEPLOY section for more information.

--resume::
  Resume the named function. This option requires --name to be specified, as
  well as --bucket and --scope for collection-aware functions. See the PAUSE
  VS UNDEPLOY section for more information.

--name <name>::
  The name of the function to take a action against. This is used by --deploy,
  --undeploy, --pause, --resume and --delete options.

--bucket <bucket>::
  The bucket to which the function to take an action against belongs. This
  needs to be specified together with --scope or both should be omitted for
  collection-unaware functions. This is used by --deploy, --undeploy, --pause,
  --resume and --delete options.

--scope <scope>::
  The scope to which the function to take an action against belongs. This
  needs to be specified together with --bucket or both should be omitted for
  collection-unaware functions. This is used by --deploy, --undeploy, --pause,
  --resume and --delete options.

--boundary <from-everything|from-now>::
  (Deprecated) The place to start at when deploying a new function. Accepts
  'from-now' or 'from-everything' defaulting to 'from-everything' if the
  --boundary flag is omitted.

--file <file>::
  The file to import and export functions to. This is used by --export and
  --import options only.

== EXAMPLES

To import functions from a file called _functions.json_:

  $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --import --file functions.json

To export a function called _alert_function_ to a file called
_functions.json_:

  $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --export --name alert_function --file functions.json

To export all functions to a file called _functions.json_:

  $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --export-all --file functions.json

To list all functions:

  $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --list

To delete a function called _alert_function_:

  $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --delete --name alert_function

To deploy a function called _alert_function_ and process both all historical data and
new data:

  $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --deploy --name alert_function --boundary from-everything

To deploy a function called _alert_function_ and process only new data:

  $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --deploy --name alert_function --boundary from-now

To undeploy a function called _alert_function_:

  $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --undeploy --name alert_function

To pause a function called _alert_function_:

    $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
     -p password --pause --name alert_function

To resume a function called _alert_function_:

    $ couchbase-cli eventing-function-setup -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
     -p password --resume --name alert_function

== UNDEPLOY VS PAUSE
Once you undeploy an eventing function you will have no opportunity to resume
from the point at which the function was undeployed; this is not the case for
pause/resume. Pausing an eventing function allows you to make changes to it
or its settings while retaining the ability to continue from the point at
which the function was paused.
