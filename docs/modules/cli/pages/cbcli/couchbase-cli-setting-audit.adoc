== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
_couchbase-cli setting-audit_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
    [--password <password>] [--audit-enabled <num>] [--audit-log-path <path>]
    [--audit-log-rotate-interval <seconds>]

== DESCRIPTION

Auditing is used to observe the action of users in the cluster. It is usually
turned on for security purposes to ensure that those without permission to
access information do not access it. By default auditing is disabled in
Couchbase. The setting-audit command can be used to enable auditing, set the
auditing log path, and change the auditing log rotation interval.

  Specifies the audit log rotate interval. This is the interval in which the
  current audit log will be replaced with a new empty audit log file. The log
  file is rotated to ensure that the audit log does not consume too much disk
  space. The minimum audit log rotate interval is 15 minutes (900 seconds).
