Manage SSL certificates

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
_couchbase-cli ssl-manage_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
    [--password <password>] [--cluster-cert-info] [--node-cert-info]
    [--regenerate-cert <file>] [--set-node-certificate]
    [--upload-cluster-ca <file>]
    [--set-client-auth-state <enable|disable|mandatory>]
    [--set-client-auth-path <subject.cn|san.uri|san.dnsname|san.email>]
    [--set-client-auth-prefix <prefix>]
    [--set-client-auth-delimiter <delimiter>]
    [--client-auth] [--extended]

== DESCRIPTION

This command allows users to manage their SSL and X.509 certificates.

== OPTIONS

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-common-options.adoc[]

--cluster-cert-info::
  Retrieves the cluster certificate and prints it to stdout.

--node-cert-info::
  Retrieves the node certificate and prints it to stdout.

--regenerate-cert <file>::
  Regenerates the cluster certificate and saves it to the file specified in
  the value fo this option.

--set-node-certificate::
  Sets the node certificate. Before running this command you must copy the
  node certificate into your installation. When this command is invoked the
  cluster will read the node certificate from the node specified and set it
  as the node certificate for that node.

--upload-cluster-ca <file>::
  Uploads the certificate specified to the cluster. The uploaded certificate
  will replace the cluster certificate in this cluster.

--set-client-auth <path>::
  Specifies a path to the client auth configuration file. This file should
  contain the state of client auth and one or more prefixes. The state defines
  whether or not client auth should used. The possible values for this field
  are below:
+
--
  * disabled: no client certification
  * enable: if the client presents a valid client certificate then we try
    and validate it. If the validation fails or no certificate is presented we
    fall back to the existing authentication methods
  * mandatory: the client has to present valid SSL certificate in order to
    access successfully authorise the connection.

[normal]
  The prefixes section should contain one or more prefixes and each prefix
  should contain a path, prefix, and delimiter. More information about these
  sub-fields is below:

  * path: The field which will be used to extract the username from the
    certificate. Currently only subject.cn, san.uri, san.email and san.dnsname
    are allowed
  * prefix: Optional. Prefix to be ignored from the field value
  * delimiter: Optional. The delimiter can either be a string or a character,
    the parsing of the username ends when the delimter value is found.

[normal]
  Below is an example of what a client auth configuraiton file might look
  like:

  {
    "state": "enable",
    "prefixes": [
      {
        "path": "subject.cn",
        "prefix": "www.cb-",
        "delimiter": "."
      }
    ]
  }
--

--client-auth::
  This options used to get the client cert auth value

--extended::
  This option is used with the --cluster-cert-info and specifies that extended
  cluster certificate information should be printed to stdout.

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-host-formats.adoc[]

== EXAMPLES

To get cluster certificate information run the following command.

  $ couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --cluster-cert-info

Note that you can also get extended cluster certificate information by adding the
--extended flag as shown below.

  $ couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --cluster-cert-info --extended

To get node certificate information run the following command. Note that the
node certificate will be from the node specified by the -c option.

  $ couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --node-cert-info --extended

To automatically regenerate the cluster certificate and save the new certificate
to a file at /root/new_cluster.cert run the following command.

  $ couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --regenerate-cert /root/new_cluster.cert

Note that the command above should never be run if you are using X.509
certificates because using the --regenerate-cert command will generate an
unsigned certificate for the cluster to use.

To update a node certificate you will first need to copy the new certificate to
the certificate inbox folder on the node you wish to change the certificate.
Once you have done this you can run the command below to tell the server to
begin using the new certificate.

  $ couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --set-node-certificate

To update the cluster certificate you can run the command below. Note that our
certificate is located at /root/new_cluster.cert in this example.

  $ couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --upload-cluster-ca /root/new_cluster.cert

To set the client cert auth to mandatory, following command can be run.

  $ couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --set-client-auth mandatory

To get the client cert auth value, following command should be run.

  $ couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 192.168.1.5 -u Administrator \
   -p password --client-auth
