Failover a node in the cluster

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
_couchbase-cli failover_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>] [--password <password>]
    [--client-cert <path>] [--client-cert-password <password>] [--client-key <path>]
    [--client-key-password <password>] [--server-failover <server_list>] [--hard]
    [--force] [--no-progress-bar] [--no-wait]

== DESCRIPTION

This command fails over one or more nodes. Nodes can be either hard failed
over or gracefully failed over. A hard failover means that the failover happens
immediately, but risks potential data loss. Graceful failover ensures that
replication is up to date before the node is failed over so that there is no
data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note that if a node is already down
you must perform a hard failover.

== OPTIONS

include::{partialsdir}/cbcli/part-common-options.adoc[]

--server-failover <server_list>::
  A comma separated list of nodes to failover.

--hard::
  Specifying this flag signifies that the nodes to be failed over should be
  hard failed over. A hard failover means that the failover is immediate, but
  you risk potential data loss. If this flag is not specified then a graceful
  failover will occur which ensures that the replication is up to date. This
  means there will be no data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note
  that if a server is already down you must hard fail it over.

--force::
  Specifying this flag forces a hard failover. This option should should only
  be used when needed. To be able to do a failover the cluster need a quorum
  of nodes. There are case where the majority of nodes are unavailable and it
  will be impossible to get a quorum. In those case this flag can be used to
  force a hard failover. This flag has to be used with '--hard' flag.

--no-progress-bar::
  Disables showing the progress bar which tracks the progress of the
  rebalance. Note that a rebalance only occurs for graceful failovers (e.g.
  non-forced failovers). The failover command will still wait for rebalance
  completion even if this flag is specified, but the progress bar will not
  be shown.

--no-wait::
  Specifies that this command should not wait for the completion of rebalance
  before exiting. Note that a rebalance only occurs for graceful failovers
  (e.g. non-forced failovers).

== EXAMPLES

To hard fail over two nodes run the following command:

  $ couchbase-cli failover -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
   --password password \
   --server-failover 192.168.1.6:8091,192.168.1.7:8091

To gracefully failover a node run the following command:

  $ couchbase-cli failover -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
   --password password --server-failover 192.168.1.6:8091
