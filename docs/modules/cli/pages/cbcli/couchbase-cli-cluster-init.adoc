== DESCRIPTION

Initializes the first node in a Couchbase Server cluster. Before initializing a
cluster you need to decide which services you will be running on this node as
well as the memory quota for each service you are starting. Services started
with cluster-init will be running on this server only. Future servers that are
added to this cluster may be configured with different services
running on them. Note that the data service is always required on the first
node. Memory quotas for each service are global settings and will apply to each
node added to the cluster. The memory quota for a service only applies if that
service is running on a given server. You may also define the index storage mode
which will determine how the global secondary indexes (GSI) are stored.

== OPTIONS

-c::
--cluster::
  Specifies the hostname of the cluster to initialize. By default, this
  parameter is set to localhost:8091 for this command. See the HOST FORMATS
  section for more information on specifying a hostname.

--cluster-username::
  When starting a new cluster you need to create the Couchbase Server built-in
  administrator user for the cluster. This user will be able to access the
  Couchbase Server Administration Console as well as be used for data access
  and future configuration. This option specifies the username for the
  administrator user.

--cluster-password::
  When starting a new cluster you need to create the Couchbase Server built-in
  administrator user for the cluster. This user will be able to access the
  Couchbase Server Administration Console as well as be used for data access
  and future configuration. This option specifies the password for the
  administrator user.

--cluster-ramsize::
  Specifies the data services memory quota (in MiB). This quota will be assigned
  to all future nodes added to the cluster with the data service.

--cluster-fts-ramsize::
  Sets the full-text service memory quota (in MiB). This parameter is required
  if the full-text service is specified in the --services option. This quota will
  be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the full-text
  service.

--cluster-index-ramsize::
  Sets the index service memory quota (in MiB). This parameter is required if
  the index service is specified in the --services option. This quota will be
  assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the index service.

--cluster-eventing-ramsize::
  Sets the Eventing service memory quota (in MiB). This parameter is required
  if the Eventing service is specified in the --services option. This quota
  will be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the eventing
  service.

--cluster-analytics-ramsize::
  Sets the Analytics service memory quota (in MiB). This parameter is required
  if the Analytics service is specified in the --services option. This quota
  will be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the
  analytics service.

--cluster-name::
  Sets the name for this cluster. Naming clusters is useful when you have
  multiple Couchbase Server clusters in your deployment.

--cluster-port::
  Specifies the port for the Couchbase Administration Console. Defaults to
  port 8091.

--index-storage-setting::
  Specifies the index storage mode for the index service. Accepted storage
  modes are "default" for the standard index backend or `memopt` for memory
  optimized indexes. If the index service is specified to be started with the
  --services command then this parameter defaults to "default". If the index
  service is not specified to be started then the index storage mode will not
  be set. You will then be required to set the index storage mode when the
  first index service is started on a server in the cluster. You may also
  define the index storage mode even if an index service is not started on the
  first node and it will be remembered when the first index service is added
  in the future. You may not change this parameter while there are index nodes
  in the cluster.

--services::
  Specifies the services to start on this cluster. You may not change the
  services running on this node once the cluster has been initialized. This
  options takes a comma separated list of services. Accepted services are
  "data", "index", "query", "fts", "eventing", "analytics" and "backup"
  specified as a comma-separated list. This parameter defaults to "data".

--update-notifications::
  Specifies whether or not software update notifications and sharing of system
  performance information should be enabled. To enable notifications set this
  flag to "1". To disable notifications set this flag to "0". By default it's
  enabled and notifications will be displayed in the Couchbase web console
  when a new version of Couchbase Server is available. This system also
  collects information about use and experience with the product every time an
  administrator interacts with the administrator user interface. It collects
  configuration, usage and performance data, including cluster information
  (such as settings and configuration, software version, cluster ID, load
  levels, and resource quotas), and browser and network information (such as
  IP address, inferred geolocation only at the city level, and browser type).
  This does not allow Couchbase to track your specific interactions or usage
  of Couchbase Server. Couchbase, Inc never accesses or collects any data
  stored within Couchbase Server. This feature can be disabled at any time by
  using 'couchbase-cli-setting-notification.' For more information on this
  feature, please see the “Couchbase Server Privacy FAQ” in the product
  documentation, which supplements the Couchbase Privacy Policy available
  online. This feature is only available in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.

--ip-family::
  Specifies what IP family the cluster should used. The default option is
  'ipv4'. When 'ipv4-only' or 'ipv6-only' is used the cluster will only listen
  on that address.

--node-to-node-encryption::
  Specifies if node to node encryption should be used. The default option is
  'off'. When set to 'on' all communications between nodes will be over a
  encrypted connection.

== EXAMPLES

To create a Couchbase Server cluster with only the data service on the first node
and a memory quota of 4096MiB run the following command.
----
$ couchbase-cli cluster-init -c 127.0.0.1 --cluster-username Administrator \
 --cluster-password password --services data --cluster-ramsize 4096
----
To create a Couchbase Server cluster with the data and index service then you
also need to set the memory quotas for each service as well as the index storage
mode since you are starting the index service.

To create a cluster with an index memory quota of 1024MiB, a data service memory
quota of 2048MiB and a memory optimized index storage mode run the following
command.
----
$ couchbase-cli cluster-init -c 127.0.0.1 --cluster-username Administrator \
 --cluster-password password --services data,index --cluster-ramsize 2048 \
 --cluster-index-ramsize 1024 --index-storage-setting memopt
----
To create a Couchbase Server cluster with all services then you need to set
the memory quotas for the Data, Index, Full-Text, Eventing and Analytics
service. The quotas are set to 2048MiB, 1024MiB, 1024MiB, 1024MiB and 1024MiB
respectively. A quota is not set for the query service since it does not have
a memory quota. You also need to set the index storage mode for the index
service, which will be set to "default" since the service is started on the
first node.
----
$ couchbase-cli cluster-init -c 127.0.0.1 --cluster-username Administrator \
 --cluster-password password --services data,index,query,fts,analytics \
 --cluster-ramsize 2048 --cluster-index-ramsize 1024 \
 --cluster-eventing-ramsize 1024 --cluster-fts-ramsize 1024 \
 --cluster-analytics-ramsize 1024 --cluster-fts-ramsize 1024 \
 --index-storage-setting default
----
If you want to set the port number you can do so with the --cluster-port
option. In the example below, a cluster is setup on port 5000 and starts
only the data service. The memory quota of the data service is set to 2048MiB.
----
$ couchbase-cli cluster-init -c 127.0.0.1 --cluster-username Administrator \
 --cluster-password password --services data --cluster-ramsize 2048 \
 --cluster-port 5000
----
== DISCUSSION

The cluster-init subcommand sets up the first node on a Couchbase cluster. To
set per node settings such as the data storage directory, index storage
directory, or hostname see the man:couchbase-cli-node-init[1] command. To
add nodes to a currently initialized cluster use the
man:couchbase-cli-server-add[1] command. Some cluster settings may be
changed after a cluster is initialized. Use the
man:couchbase-cli-setting-cluster[1] command to edit these settings.
