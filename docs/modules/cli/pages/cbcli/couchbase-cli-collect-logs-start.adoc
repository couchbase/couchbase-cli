Start log collection

== SYNOPSIS

[verse]
_couchbase-cli collect-logs-start_ [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
    [--password <password>] [--all-nodes] [--nodes <node_list>] [--upload]
    [--upload-host <host>] [--customer <customer>] [--ticket <ticket>]

== DESCRIPTION

This command collects all Couchbase Server log files from one or more nodes in
the cluster. Log collection is useful when there are failures in the cluster and
you need to figure out what is going on. Since there are many log files on
various different server the collect-logs-start command helps in aggregating all
of the different log file Couchbase Server creates.

To get the location of the collected log files you can run the
man:couchbase-cli-collect-logs-status[1] command either while the log collection task
is running or after the log collection task has completed. If the --upload flag
is specified then the logs will also be uploaded to the host specified in the
--upload-host flag. The upload flag is intended for Couchbase Server
Enterprise Edition users who need to upload logs to the Couchbase Support Team
to aid in diagnosing support tickets that they have filed.

Note that only one log collection task may be running at any given time in the
cluster.

== EXAMPLES

To collect logs on all nodes without uploading them run the following command.

  $ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
   --password password --all-nodes

If there is a three node cluster with IP addresses 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, and
192.168.1.7 and you only want to collect logs on the first two nodes and don't
want to upload the logs then run the command below.

  $ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
   --password password --nodes 192.168.1.5:8091,192.168.1.6:8091

If you are a Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition user and you need to upload logs
for all nodes for a support ticket then you can run the following command.

  $ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
   --password password --all-nodes --upload --upload-customer customer_name \
   --upload-host s3.amazonaws.com/cb-customers --ticket 12345
