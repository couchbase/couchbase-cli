.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to manage collections and scopes in a bucket.
Collections allow the user to categorize the data in the bucket
by creating collections and specifying a collection when adding
documents to a bucket. Scopes are the grouping of collections,
which allows further categorization and ease of management.
.sp
The following rules define a valid collection or scope name:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Must be between 1 and 30 bytes long
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Can only contain characters A\-Z, a\-z, 0\-9 and the following
symbols _ \- %
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Cannot start with _ or %
.RE
.sp
Only Couchbase and Ephemeral bucket has Collection support.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket <bucket>
.RS 4
The name of the bucket.
.RE
.sp
\-\-create\-scope <scope>
.RS 4
Makes a scope in the bucket with the name provided.
.RE
.sp
\-\-drop\-scope <scope>
.RS 4
Removes the scope from the bucket with the name provided.
.RE
.sp
\-\-list\-scopes
.RS 4
Shows all scopes in the bucket.
.RE
.sp
\-\-create\-collection <collection>
.RS 4
Makes the collection in the scope. The option takes a path in dot
format (scope.collection), specifying the scope in which the
collection and the name to be created.
.RE
.sp
\-\-drop\-collection <collection>
.RS 4
Removes the collection from the scope. The option takes a path in
dot format (scope.collection), specifying the scope from which
the collection and collection\-name are to be removed.
.RE
.sp
\-\-list\-collections [<scope>]
.RS 4
Shows all the collections in the scope provided. If the scope is not
provided, it will show the collections in the  "_default" scope.
.RE
.sp
\-\-max\-ttl <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the maximum TTL (time\-to\-live) for all documents in the
collection, in seconds. If enabled and a document is mutated with
no TTL or a TTL greater than than the maximum, its TTL will be set
to the maximum TTL. Setting this option to 0 disables the use of
max\-TTL, and the largest TTL that is allowed is 2147483647.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
