.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Initializes the first node in a Couchbase Server cluster. Before initializing a
cluster you need to decide which services you will be running on this node as
well as the memory quota for each service you are starting. Services started
with cluster\-init will be running on this server only. Future servers that are
added to this cluster may be configured with different services
running on them. Note that the data service is always required on the first
node. Memory quotas for each service are global settings and will apply to each
node added to the cluster. The memory quota for a service only applies if that
service is running on a given server. You may also define the index storage mode
which will determine how the global secondary indexes (GSI) are stored.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of the cluster to initialize. By default, this
parameter is set to localhost:8091 for this command. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-username
.RS 4
When starting a new cluster you need to create the Couchbase Server built\-in
administrator user for the cluster. This user will be able to access the
Couchbase Server Administration Console as well as be used for data access
and future configuration. This option specifies the username for the
administrator user.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-password
.RS 4
When starting a new cluster you need to create the Couchbase Server built\-in
administrator user for the cluster. This user will be able to access the
Couchbase Server Administration Console as well as be used for data access
and future configuration. This option specifies the password for the
administrator user.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-ramsize
.RS 4
Specifies the data services memory quota (in MiB). This quota will be assigned
to all future nodes added to the cluster with the data service.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-fts\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the full\-text service memory quota (in MiB). This parameter is required
if the full\-text service is specified in the \-\-services option. This quota will
be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the full\-text
service.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-index\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the index service memory quota (in MiB). This parameter is required if
the index service is specified in the \-\-services option. This quota will be
assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the index service.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-eventing\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the Eventing service memory quota (in MiB). This parameter is required
if the Eventing service is specified in the \-\-services option. This quota
will be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the eventing
service.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-analytics\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the Analytics service memory quota (in MiB). This parameter is required
if the Analytics service is specified in the \-\-services option. This quota
will be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the
analytics service.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-name
.RS 4
Sets the name for this cluster. Naming clusters is useful when you have
multiple Couchbase Server clusters in your deployment.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-port
.RS 4
Specifies the port for the Couchbase Administration Console. Defaults to
port 8091.
.RE
.sp
\-\-index\-storage\-setting
.RS 4
Specifies the index storage mode for the index service. Accepted storage
modes are "default" for the standard index backend or \f(CRmemopt\fP for memory
optimized indexes. If the index service is specified to be started with the
\-\-services command then this parameter defaults to "default". If the index
service is not specified to be started then the index storage mode will not
be set. You will then be required to set the index storage mode when the
first index service is started on a server in the cluster. You may also
define the index storage mode even if an index service is not started on the
first node and it will be remembered when the first index service is added
in the future. You may not change this parameter while there are index nodes
in the cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-services
.RS 4
Specifies the services to start on this cluster. You may not change the
services running on this node once the cluster has been initialized. This
options takes a comma separated list of services. Accepted services are
"data", "index", "query", "fts", "eventing", "analytics" and "backup"
specified as a comma\-separated list. This parameter defaults to "data".
.RE
.sp
\-\-update\-notifications
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not software update notifications and sharing of system
performance information should be enabled. To enable notifications set this
flag to "1". To disable notifications set this flag to "0". By default it\(cqs
enabled and notifications will be displayed in the Couchbase web console
when a new version of Couchbase Server is available. This system also
collects information about use and experience with the product every time an
administrator interacts with the administrator user interface. It collects
configuration, usage and performance data, including cluster information
(such as settings and configuration, software version, cluster ID, load
levels, and resource quotas), and browser and network information (such as
IP address, inferred geolocation only at the city level, and browser type).
This does not allow Couchbase to track your specific interactions or usage
of Couchbase Server. Couchbase, Inc never accesses or collects any data
stored within Couchbase Server. This feature can be disabled at any time by
using \*(Aqcouchbase\-cli\-setting\-notification.\*(Aq For more information on this
feature, please see the “Couchbase Server Privacy FAQ” in the product
documentation, which supplements the Couchbase Privacy Policy available
online.
.RE
.sp
\-\-ip\-family
.RS 4
Specifies what IP family the cluster should used. The default option is
\*(Aqipv4\*(Aq. When \*(Aqipv4\-only\*(Aq or \*(Aqipv6\-only\*(Aq is used the cluster will only listen
on that address.
.RE
.sp
\-\-node\-to\-node\-encryption
.RS 4
Specifies if node to node encryption should be used. The default option is
\*(Aqoff\*(Aq. When set to \*(Aqon\*(Aq all communications between nodes will be over a
encrypted connection.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3

.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To create a Couchbase Server cluster with only the data service on the first node
and a memory quota of 4096MiB run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-init \-c 127.0.0.1 \-\-cluster\-username Administrator \(rs

.if n .RE
.sp
To create a Couchbase Server cluster with the data and index service then you
also need to set the memory quotas for each service as well as the index storage
mode since you are starting the index service.
.sp
To create a cluster with an index memory quota of 1024MiB, a data service memory
quota of 2048MiB and a memory optimized index storage mode run the following
command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To create a Couchbase Server cluster with all services then you need to set
the memory quotas for the Data, Index, Full\-Text, Eventing and Analytics
service. The quotas are set to 2048MiB, 1024MiB, 1024MiB, 1024MiB and 1024MiB
respectively. A quota is not set for the query service since it does not have
a memory quota. You also need to set the index storage mode for the index
service, which will be set to "default" since the service is started on the
first node.

If you want to set the port number you can do so with the \-\-cluster\-port
option. In the example below, a cluster is setup on port 5000 and starts
only the data service. The memory quota of the data service is set to 2048MiB.

The cluster\-init subcommand sets up the first node on a Couchbase cluster. To
set per node settings such as the data storage directory, index storage
directory, or hostname see the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-node\-init\fP(1) command. To
add nodes to a currently initialized cluster use the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-server\-add\fP(1) command. Some cluster settings may be
changed after a cluster is initialized. Use the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-setting\-cluster\fP(1) command to edit these settings.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
