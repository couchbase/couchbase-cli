.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to set up email alerts on a cluster. Couchbase provides
alerts for various issues that may arise in the cluster where it is recommended
that the cluster administrator take action to ensure that applications continue
to function properly. When setting up email alerts administrator can decide who
gets alert emails and which alerts are sent.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-email\-alert <num>
.RS 4
Enables email alerts on this cluster. Set this option to "1" to enable
alerts or "0" to disable alerts. This parameter is required.

.RS 4
A comma separated list of users to email when an alert is raised in the
server.

.RS 4
If email alerts an enabled then this option will set the sender email
address.
.RE
.sp

.RS 4
The email server username for the sender email address. This field is
required if the email address provided requires authentication.
.RE
.sp
\-\-email\-password <password>
.RS 4
The email server password for the sender email address. This field is
required if the email address provided requires authentication.
.RE
.sp

.RS 4
The email server hostname that hosts the email address specified by the
\-\-sender\-email option.
.RE
.sp
\-\-email\-port <port>

specified by the \-\-sender\-email option.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-email\-encrypt <num>
.RS 4
Enables SSL encryption when connecting to the email server. Set this option
to "1" to enable encryption or "0" to disable encryption. If this option is
not set then encryption will be disabled.
.RE
.sp
\-\-alert\-auto\-failover\-node

Specifies that an email alert should be sent when a node is automatically
failed over.
.RE
.sp
\-\-alert\-auto\-failover\-max\-reached
.RS 4
Specifies that an email alert should be sent when the maximum amount of
auto\-failovers is reached.
.RE
.sp
\-\-alert\-auto\-failover\-node\-down
.RS 4
Specifies that an email alert should be sent when auto\-failover could not be
completed because another node in the cluster was already down.
.RE
.sp
\-\-alert\-auto\-failover\-cluster\-small
.RS 4
Specifies that an email alert should be sent when auto\-failover could not be
completed because the cluster is too small.
.RE
.sp
\-\-alert\-auto\-failover\-disable
.RS 4

the data service is more than 50%.
.RE
.sp
\-\-alert\-meta\-oom

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To enable failover related email alerts for two users without email encryption
run the following command below:
.sp

To disable email alerts run the following command:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
