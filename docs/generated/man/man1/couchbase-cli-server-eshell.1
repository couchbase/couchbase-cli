.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This is a hidden command and is not intended for typical production use. This
command allows the user to connect to the cluster manager process in order to
make unsupported changes in the cluster manager. This command is typically used
as last resort in order to address uncommon production issues. Check with the
Couchbase Support team before running this command because improper use can lead
to the cluster being placed in an unusable state.
.sp
When this command is executed it connects to the cluster manager process
specified and starts a shell so that the user can interact with the cluster
manager.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-vm
.RS 4
The part of the cluster manager to connect to. This option can either be set
to babysitter, couchdb, or ns_server. The babysitter vm is a monitor that
ensures the cluster manager is always running and is restarted in the event
of a crash or error. The couchdb vm runs the views service on each data node
and the ns_server vm corresponds to the cluster manager. By default the vm
option is set to ns_server.
.RE
.sp
\-\-erl
.RS 4
Specified the location of the erlang process. This parameter should be set
if the default erlang process that is shipped with Couchbase is not the
correct executable to connect to the cluster manager with.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To connect to the cluster manager process you can run the following command
below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-eshell \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
Erlang R16B03\-1 (erts\-5.10.4.0.0.1)
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
Eshell V5.10.4.0.0.1  (abort with ^G)
(n_0@192.168.1.5)1>
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
When the command is executed it will bring up a shell that is connected to the
vm specified in the command. Since the \-\-vm parameter is not specified we
connect to the default ns_server vm.
.sp
To connect to the babysitter vm the following command would be run.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-eshell \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-vm babysitter
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf

.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
Eshell V5.10.4.0.0.1  (abort with ^G)
(n_0@192.168.1.5)1>
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To exit the shell send the SIGINT signal. This can be done by typing Ctrl\-C.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
