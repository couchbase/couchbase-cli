.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The server\-add subcommand is used to add one or more servers to a cluster.
Before adding a server it is important to decide which services the server will
be running and whether or not the server should be a part of a specific group.
Keep in mind that if the index service is being added on one of the servers and
the cluster is not currently running the index service that you also need to
set the index storage mode. This can be done with the \-\-index\-storage\-setting
option.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-add <servers>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of servers to add to the cluster. The each server in
the list should be identified by a hostname or IP address.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-add\-username <username>
.RS 4
Adding a server to the cluster can only be done by a user with the
appropriate credentials. This flag specifies the username for a user who
has the ability to modify the cluster topology on the server being added.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-add\-password <password>
.RS 4
Adding a server to the cluster can only be done by a user with the
appropriate credentials. This flag specifies the password for a user who
has the ability to modify the cluster topology on the server being added.
.RE
.sp
\-\-group\-name <name>
.RS 4
The name of the group to add the server to. If this option is not specified
then the server is added to the default group.
.RE
.sp
\-\-services <services>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of services that this server should be running.
Accepted services are "data", "index", "query", "fts", "eventing" and
"analytics".
.RE
.sp
\-\-index\-storage\-setting <mode>
.RS 4
Specifies the index storage mode. This parameter must be set if the servers
being added contain the index service and this is the first time the index
service is being added in this cluster. You may specify "default" for disk
based indexes or "memopt" for memory optimized indexes.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
If we want to add a server at 192.168.1.6:8091 with the index, data and query
service on it then we would run the command below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-add \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-add 192.168.1.6:8091 \(rs
 \-\-server\-add\-username Administrator \-\-server\-add\-password password
 \-\-services data,index,query
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note that in the example above we set the username and password of the server
being added to the same value as the username and password of the servers
already in the cluster. This is done if the server being added has not already
been initialized. If the server being added has been initialized then you will
need to specify an appropriate username and password for the server being added.
.sp
Now lets add two server to the East group with data, index,and full\-text
services. In this example we will also assume that the index is being added for
the first time so we need to specify the index storage mode. If we want to index
storage mode to be memory optimized then we would run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-add \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-readd 192.168.1.6:8091,192.168.1.7:8091 \(rs
 \-\-server\-username Administrator \-\-server\-password password
 \-\-services data,fts \-\-group\-name \-\-index\-storage\-setting memopt
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
