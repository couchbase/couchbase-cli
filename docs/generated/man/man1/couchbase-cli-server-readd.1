.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
DEPRECATED: This command was deprecated in 5.0.0 and will be removed in future
releases. Please use the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-recovery\fP(1) subcommand which
provides similar functionality to this command.
.sp
The server\-readd subcommand is used to add a server back to the cluster. This
operation is useful after a node is failed over and also when a node is
removed from the cluster for maintenance.
.sp
When a node is failed over and removed from the cluster it may be able to
be added back to the cluster. An example of this is when a node loses power.
This node might get failed over and removed from the cluster, but once power
is restored to the node you may want to add it back to the cluster.
.sp
Another use case is taking a node out of the cluster for maintenance. This
is done by gracefully failing over a node to ensure there is no data loss.
The administrator can then perform maintenance on the removed node and add it
back with the server\-readd command.
.sp
It is also possible to add a server back to the cluster without removing the
data and instead having the server recover data from where it left off. This is
called delta recovery and is available from the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-recovery\fP(1) subcommand.
.sp
Note that after the server\-readd subcommand is run you must rebalance the
cluster. See the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-rebalance\fP(1) command for more
information on rebalancing a cluster.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-add <servers>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of nodes to readd. The each server should
correspond to the hostname or IP address of a server to be added back to
the cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-username <username>
.RS 4
Adding a node back to the cluster can only be done by a user with the
appropriate credentials. This flag specifies the username for a user who
has the ability to modify the cluster topology of the node being added
back.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-password <password>
.RS 4
Adding a node back to the cluster can only be done by a user with the
appropriate credentials. This flag specifies the password for a user who
has the ability to modify the cluster topology of the node being added
back.
.RE
.sp
\-\-group\-name <name>
.RS 4
The name of the group to add the node to.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
If there is a node at 192.168.1.6:8091 that you want to add back and that
node has credentials that allow us to change the cluster topology with
"Administrator" as the username and "password" as the password, run the
following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-readd \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-readd 192.168.1.6:8091 \(rs
 \-\-server\-username Administrator \-\-server\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If you need to add back multiple nodes then you would run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-readd \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-readd 192.168.1.6:8091,192.168.1.7:8091 \(rs
 \-\-server\-username Administrator \-\-server\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If you wanted the nodes being added back to the cluster to be a part of the
"East" group we would run the following command
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-readd \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-readd 192.168.1.6:8091 \-\-group\-name East \(rs
 \-\-server\-username Administrator \-\-server\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
