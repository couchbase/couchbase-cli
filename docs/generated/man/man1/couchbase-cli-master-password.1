.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition has a "Secret Management" feature, which
allows users to securely encrypt passwords and other sensitive configuration
information that is stored on disk. These secrets must be stored in a secure
way, and access must be controlled to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.
By using Secret Management in Couchbase Server, secrets are written to disk
in encrypted format. To decrypt these secrets, Couchbase requires the
entering of  a "master password", which is supplied by the user during server
startup. This master password can be passed to the server using this command.
.sp
By default the Secret Management feature is disabled. To enable the feature,
you must first set the master password. Once a master password is set, the
user is required to enter it when the server starts up. This can be done by
setting the environment variable CB_MASTER_PASSWORD=<password> during server
startup or by using this command to send the password to the node. This
command must be run locally on the node that needs to be unlocked.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-\-send\-password
.RS 4
Sends the master password to the server that is waiting to start up.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To use the Secret Management feature, the first thing you need to do is set a
password on each node of the cluster. To do this, install, start and initialize
Couchbase. Once Couchbase has started, run the following command to set the master
password for your server.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-master\-password \-c 127.0.0.1 \-u Administrator \(rs
  \-p password \-\-new\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Once the master password is configured restart the server. Upon restarting the
cluster you will notice that the server doesn\(cqt fully start. This is because it
is waiting for you to enter the master password. You can do this by running the
command below. The master\-password subcommand has to be  run locally on the node
that is waiting for the master password.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli master\-password \-\-send\-password password
.fi
