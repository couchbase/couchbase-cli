.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp

 \-p password \-\-get
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To set a new password policy where the minimum password length is 10 character
and require that all passwords contain an upper case letter, lower case letter,
and a digit run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-password\-policy \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-set \-\-min\-length 10 \-\-uppercase 1 \-\-lowercase 1 \-\-digits 1
.fi
.if n .RE
