.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To create a new XDCR replication from the "default" bucket to the "apps" bucket
on a remote cluster called "east" using the xmem replication protocol. You can
run the following command below. Note that if you have not setup a remote
cluster reference then you need to do this first by running the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-xdcr\-setup\fP(1).
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.if n .RE
.sp
To list all of the current XDCR replication you can run the following command.
.sp

 \-p password \-\-list

.sp
To delete an XDCR replication you first need to use the \-\-list flag to get the
replicator id. Once you get the replicator id (in this case we will assume it is
f4eb540d74c43fd3ac6d4b7910c8c92f/default/default) you can run the command below
to delete the replication.

To pause an XDCR replication you first need to use the \-\-list flag to get the
replicator id. Once you get the replicator id (in this case we will assume it is

to pause the replication.

To modify the settings of an XDCR replication you first need to use the \-\-list
flag to get the replicator id. Once you get the replicator id (in this case we
will assume it is f4eb540d74c43fd3ac6d4b7910c8c92f/default/default) you can run
the command if for example you wanted to change the document batch size to 2048
and failure restart interval to 60 seconds.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
