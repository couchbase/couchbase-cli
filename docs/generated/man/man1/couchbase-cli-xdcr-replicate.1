.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To create a new XDCR replication from the "default" bucket to the "apps" bucket
on a remote cluster called "east" using the xmem replication protocol. You can
run the following command below. Note that if you have not setup a remote
cluster reference then you need to do this first by running the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-xdcr\-setup\fP(1).
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-replicate \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-create \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east \-\-xdcr\-from\-bucket apps \(rs
 \-\-xdcr\-to\-bucket apps \-\-xdcr\-replication\-mode xmem
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To list all of the current XDCR replication you can run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-replicate \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-list

.if n .RE
.sp
To delete an XDCR replication you first need to use the \-\-list flag to get the
replicator id. Once you get the replicator id (in this case we will assume it is
f4eb540d74c43fd3ac6d4b7910c8c92f/default/default) you can run the command below
to delete the replication.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf

 \-p password \-\-delete \(rs

.if n .RE
.sp
To pause an XDCR replication you first need to use the \-\-list flag to get the
replicator id. Once you get the replicator id (in this case we will assume it is
f4eb540d74c43fd3ac6d4b7910c8c92f/default/default) you can run the command below
to pause the replication.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

To resume an XDCR replication you first need to use the \-\-list flag to get the
replicator id. Once you get the replicator id (in this case we will assume it is
f4eb540d74c43fd3ac6d4b7910c8c92f/default/default) you can run the command below
to resume the replication.

.sp
To modify the settings of an XDCR replication you first need to use the \-\-list
flag to get the replicator id. Once you get the replicator id (in this case we
will assume it is f4eb540d74c43fd3ac6d4b7910c8c92f/default/default) you can run
the command if for example you wanted to change the document batch size to 2048
and failure restart interval to 60 seconds.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
