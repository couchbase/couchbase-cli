\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.

To create a new XDCR replication from the "default" bucket to the "apps" bucket
on a remote cluster called "east". You can run the following command below.
Note that if you have not setup a remote cluster reference then you need to
do this first by running the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-xdcr\-setup\fP(1).

.SH "COLLECTION MAPPINGS"
.sp
By default, upgraded bucket\-to\-bucket replication includes implicit mapping of all
scope and collections replications of which the bucket contains to globally unique
entities on the remote cluster. This means that whatever collection exists in the
source will be implicitly mapped by name to the target, and the data replicated.
For example, if a namespace such as S1:C1 exists on the source, Implicit Mapping
states that the equivalent mapped entity of S1:C1 namespace should also exist on
the target. If brand\-new replicated systems that both support Collections are
created with Implicit Mapping without specifying anything regarding collections,
this is also the behavior of the system. If there is a default scope and/or default
collection, they will be mapped to the default scope/collection on the target cluster.
.sp
For users who require more detailed control over collections, they may choose to
use Explicit Mapping. Explicit mapping for a replication is specified by a set of
rules defined below.

Note that when migration mode is enabled Explicit Rule\-Based Mapping is used
instead. The Rule\-Based Mapping expressions have the same format as the filtering
expressions in advance filtering. Below are some example rules. Note that the filter
