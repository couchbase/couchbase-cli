.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command allows users to manage their SSL and X.509 certificates.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-cert\-info
.RS 4
Retrieves the cluster certificate and prints it to stdout.
.RE
.sp
\-\-node\-cert\-info
.RS 4
Retrieves the node certificate and prints it to stdout.
.RE
.sp
\-\-regenerate\-cert <file>
.RS 4
Regenerates the cluster certificate and saves it to the file specified in
the value fo this option.
.RE
.sp
\-\-set\-node\-certificate
.RS 4
Sets the node certificate. Before running this command you must copy the
node certificate into your installation. When this command is invoked the
cluster will read the node certificate from the node specified and set it
as the node certificate for that node.
.RE
.sp
\-\-upload\-cluster\-ca <file>
.RS 4
Uploads the certificate specified to the cluster. The uploaded certificate
will replace the cluster certificate in this cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-set\-client\-auth <path>
.RS 4
Specifies a path to the client auth configuration file. This file should
contain the state of client auth and one or more prefixes. The state defines
whether or not client auth should used. The possible values for this field
are below:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
disabled: no client certification
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
enable: if the client presents a valid client certificate then we try
and validate it. If the validation fails or no certificate is presented we
fall back to the existing authentication methods
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
mandatory: the client has to present valid SSL certificate in order to
access successfully authorise the connection.
.RE
.sp
The prefixes section should contain one or more prefixes and each prefix
should contain a path, prefix, and delimiter. More information about these
sub\-fields is below:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
path: The field which will be used to extract the username from the
certificate. Currently only subject.cn, san.uri, san.email and san.dnsname
are allowed
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
prefix: Optional. Prefix to be ignored from the field value
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
delimiter: Optional. The delimiter can either be a string or a character,
the parsing of the username ends when the delimter value is found.
.RE
.sp
Below is an example of what a client auth configuraiton file might look
like:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
{
  "state": "enable",
  "prefixes": [
    {
      "path": "subject.cn",
      "prefix": "www.cb\-",
      "delimiter": "."
    }
  ]
}
.fi
.if n .RE
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-auth
.RS 4
This options used to get the client cert auth value
.RE
.sp
\-\-extended
.RS 4
This option is used with the \-\-cluster\-cert\-info and specifies that extended
cluster certificate information should be printed to stdout.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

To get cluster certificate information run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli ssl\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-cluster\-cert\-info
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note that you can also get extended cluster certificate information by adding the
\-\-extended flag as shown below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli ssl\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-cluster\-cert\-info \-\-extended
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To get node certificate information run the following command. Note that the
node certificate will be from the node specified by the \-c option.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli ssl\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-node\-cert\-info \-\-extended
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To automatically regenerate the cluster certificate and save the new certificate
to a file at /root/new_cluster.cert run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli ssl\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-regenerate\-cert /root/new_cluster.cert
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note that the command above should never be run if you are using X.509
certificates because using the \-\-regenerate\-cert command will generate an
unsigned certificate for the cluster to use.
.sp
To update a node certificate you will first need to copy the new certificate to
the certificate inbox folder on the node you wish to change the certificate.
Once you have done this you can run the command below to tell the server to
begin using the new certificate.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli ssl\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-set\-node\-certificate
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To update the cluster certificate you can run the command below. Note that our
certificate is located at /root/new_cluster.cert in this example.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf

 \-p password \-\-upload\-cluster\-ca /root/new_cluster.cert

To set the client cert auth to mandatory, following command can be run.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

$ couchbase\-cli ssl\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-set\-client\-auth mandatory

To get the client cert auth value, following command should be run.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
