.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command changes the IP family used for inter\-cluster communication.
To do this it will execute a number of instructions in each node in the
cluster. The clusters names must be FQDN and not IP addresses. It also
provides an option to retrieve the current IP family being used.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-get
.RS 4
Show current IP family.
.RE
.sp
\-\-set
.RS 4
Change the cluster IP family, specify the IP family to be used using the
\-\-ipv4 or \-\-ipv6 flags.
.RE
.sp
\-\-ipv4
.RS 4
When specified together with \-\-set it will change the cluster to use IP for
communication between the nodes.
.RE
.sp
\-\-ipv6
.RS 4
When specified together with \-\-set it will change the cluster to use IP for
communication between the nodes.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
For a cluster with nodes [cb1.com, cb2.com, cb3.com] communicating via IPv4 we
can change the IP family being used to IPv6 by using the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli ip\-family \-c http://cb1.com:8091 \-u Administrator \(rs
  \-p password \-\-set \-\-ipv6
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
This command will configure each node in the cluster to use IPv6. To check what
family is being used use the command below:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli ip\-family \-c http://cb1.com:8091 \-u Administrator \(rs
  \-p password \-\-get
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
