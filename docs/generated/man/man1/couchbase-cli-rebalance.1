.SH "NAME"
couchbase\-cli\-rebalance \- Rebalances data and indexes across nodes in a cluster
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIcouchbase\-cli rebalance\fP [\-\-cluster <url>] [\-\-username <user>]
    [\-\-password <password>] [\-\-server\-remove <servers>] [\-\-no\-progress\-bar]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Rebalances data and indexes across all nodes in the cluster. This command
should be used after nodes are added, removed, or failed over from the cluster
in order to ensure that each node in the cluster has a similar "balanced" amount
of data and indexes.
.sp
To add nodes use the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-server\-add\fP(1) subcommand. To
remove nodes specify the list of nodes to remove using the \-\-server\-remove
option in the rebalance subcommand. To failover nodes see the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-failover\fP(1) subcommand. After running the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-server\-add\fP(1) or \fBcouchbase\-cli\-failover\fP(1)
subcommands ensure that you run the rebalance command to balance data and indexes
across the cluster.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-remove <servers>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of nodes to remove from the cluster. Each node
in the list should correspond to the hostname or IP address of that
server.
.RE
.sp
\-\-no\-progress\-bar
.RS 4
Hides the progress bar which tracks the progress of the
rebalance. This command will still wait for rebalance completion even if
this flag is specified, but the progress bar will not be shown.
.RE
.sp
\-\-no\-wait
.RS 4
Specifies that this command should not wait for the completion of rebalance
before exiting.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To rebalance a new node into the cluster you would first add a node using
the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-server\-add\fP(1) command and then start the rebalance
with the rebalance command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-add \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-add 192.168.1.6:8091 \(rs
 \-\-server\-add\-username Administrator \-\-server\-add\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli rebalance \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If you just want to remove a node from the cluster and start a rebalance,
just run the rebalance command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli rebalance \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-remove 192.168.1.6:8091
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
You can remove multiple nodes at once and run the rebalance with the
command below. Note that it will be faster overall removing multiple nodes
at once as opposed to removing them one at a time.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli rebalance \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-remove 192.168.1.6:8091,192.168.1.7:8091
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To add a node and remove another node you need to run the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-server\-add\fP(1) command before starting the rebalance,
as shown below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-add \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-add 192.168.1.6:8091 \(rs
 \-\-server\-add\-username Administrator \-\-server\-add\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli rebalance \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-remove 192.168.1.7:8091
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If you add one node to the cluster and remove a node during the same
rebalance, Couchbase Server will do a "swap rebalance". This means data and
indexes from the node being removed are moved to the one being added. This
means the rebalance will only occur between these two nodes as
opposed to involving all nodes in the cluster.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
