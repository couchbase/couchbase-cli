.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command allows users to enable SASL on their cluster as well as add
administrator and read\-only administrator SASL users to their cluster.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-admins <admins_list>
.RS 4
A list of SASL users who should have administrator privileges on this
cluster. This list should be comma separated if multiple users are being
added.
.RE
.sp
\-\-roadmins <ro_admin_list>
.RS 4
A list of SASL users who should have read\-only administrator privileges on
this cluster. This list should be comma separated if multiple users are
being added.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enabled <1|0>
.RS 4
Enables or disables SASL on this cluster. To enable SASL set this option to
"1". To disable SASL set this parameter to "0".
.RE
.sp
\-\-default <default>
.RS 4
Specifies the default role for SASL users who have not been explicitly been
added to the cluster. This option may be set to "admins", "ro_admins", or
"none". If this option is set to "admins" then all SASL users not explicitly
add to this cluster have administrator privileges. If this option is set to
"roadmins" then all SASL users not explicitly add to this cluster have
read\-only administrator privileges. If this option is set to "none" then all
SASL users not explicitly add to this cluster will have no access. This
option default to "none".
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
