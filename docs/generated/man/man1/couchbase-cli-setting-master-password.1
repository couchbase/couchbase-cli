.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition has a "Secret Management" feature, which
allows users to securely encrypt passwords and other sensitive configuration
information that is stored on disk. These secrets must be stored in a secure
way; and access must be controlled, to reduce the risk of accidental exposure.
By using Secret Management in Couchbase Server, secrets are written to disk
in encrypted format. To decrypt these secrets, Couchbase requires entry of a
"master password", which is supplied by the user during server startup. This
master password can be passed to the server using the couchbase\-cli
master\-password command.
.sp
By default, the Secret Management feature is disabled. To enable the feature,
you must first set the master password. Once a master password is set, the
user is required to enter it when the server starts up. This can be done by
setting the environment variable CB_MASTER_PASSWORD=<password> during server
startup.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-rotate\-data\-key
.RS 4
Secrets are encrypted using a data key file, which is a unique key that is
stored on disk for each server. To open this file, the master password is
used to generate a key which decrypts the contents of the data key file.
The contents of the decrypted data key file can then be used to decrypt
secrets. Some users may want to generate a new data key file periodically,
to increase security. This option is used to generate a new data key file.
.RE
.sp
\-\-new\-password
.RS 4
Sets a new master password for the server specified. The user may specify
this password on the command line, or through non\-echoed stdin. To specify
the password through non\-echoed stdin, do not provide a value for this
option. The user will then be prompted to enter the password.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To use the Secret Management feature, the first thing you need to do is set a
password on each node of the cluster. To do this, install and start Couchbase,
but don\(cqt go through the setup process or initialize the cluster. Once
Couchbase has started, run the following command to set the master password
for your server.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-master\-password \-c 127.0.0.1 \-u Administrator \(rs
  \-p password \-\-new\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Once the master password is configured restart the server. Upon restarting the
cluster you will notice that the server doesn\(cqt fully start. This is because it
is waiting for you to enter the master password. You can do this by running the
command below. The master\-password subcommand has to be  run locally on the node
that is waiting for the master password.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli master\-password \-\-send\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note you can also use the CB_MASTER_PASSWORD=<password> environmental variable
to pass the password to the node during startup.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
