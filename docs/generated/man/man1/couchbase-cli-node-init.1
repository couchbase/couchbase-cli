.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command initializes a Couchbase Server node. In particular this command
allows the user to set the node\(cqs data path, index path, and hostname. The data
path, index path and hostname must be set prior to initializing the cluster or
adding the node to an existing cluster. The hostname however can be
changed later if the node is the only node in the cluster.
.sp
To get the best performance from Couchbase Server, it is recommended that the
data and index paths be set to separate disks.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-node\-init\-data\-path
.RS 4
The path to store data files create by the Couchbase data service. Note that
this path is also where view indexes are written on this server. This flag
can only be specified against a node that is not yet part of a cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-node\-init\-index\-path
.RS 4
The path to store files create by the Couchbase index service. This flag can
only be specified against a node that is not yet part of a cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-node\-init\-hostname
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname for this server.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To initialize a node and set the index path to /mnt1/indexes and the data path
to /mnt2/data run the following command. Note that this command must be run
before the node becomes part of a cluster.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli node\-init \-c 192.168.1.5 \(rs
 \-\-node\-init\-data\-path /mnt2/data \-\-node\-init\-index\-path /mnt1/indexes
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
In the command above, the cluster username and password have not yet been set so
you can skip adding these to the command line. If you later initialize the cluster
and want to set the hostname for the cluster, then run the command
below. Note that this time the cluster is initialized, so you must include the
username and password.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli node\-init \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
 \-\-hostname cb1.mydomain.com
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
You could have alternatively set all three of these options below before
initializing the cluster. This can be done with the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli node\-init \-c 192.168.1.5 \-\-hostname cb1.mydomain.com \(rs
 \-\-node\-init\-data\-path /mnt2/data \-\-node\-init\-index\-path /mnt1/indexes
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Again, note that you don\(cqt need the username and password because in this example
the cluster has not yet been initialized.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
