.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command initializes a Couchbase Server node. In particular this command
allows the user to set the data path, index path, analytics path, java home
and hostname. These settings must be set prior to initializing the cluster or
adding the node to an existing cluster as they cannot be changed later. The
hostname however can be changed later if the node is the only node in the
cluster.
.sp
To get the best performance from Couchbase Server, it is recommended that the
data, index and analytics paths be set to separate disks.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert <path>
.RS 4
The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a
cluster. May be supplied with \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP as an alternative to the
\f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP flags.  See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION
section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag, when
using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12
format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key <path>
.RS 4
The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the
certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag. May be supplied with
\f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP as an alternative to the \f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP
flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key\-password <password>
.RS 4

AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-node\-init\-data\-path

can only be specified against a node that is not yet part of a cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-node\-init\-index\-path
.RS 4
The path to store files create by the Couchbase index service. This flag can
only be specified against a node that is not yet part of a cluster.
.RE

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/PEM OR DER ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To initialize a node and set the index path to \f(CR/mnt1/indexes\fP and the data path
to \f(CR/mnt2/data\fP run the following command. Note that this command must be run
before the node becomes part of a cluster.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ couchbase\-cli node\-init \-c 192.168.1.5 \(rs
   \-\-node\-init\-data\-path /mnt2/data \-\-node\-init\-index\-path /mnt1/indexes
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
In the command above, the cluster username and password have not yet been set so
you can skip adding these to the command line. If you later initialize the cluster
and want to set the hostname for the cluster, then run the command
below. Note that this time the cluster is initialized, so you must include the
username and password.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ couchbase\-cli node\-init \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
   \-\-node\-init\-hostname cb1.mydomain.com
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
You could have alternatively set all five of these options below before
initializing the cluster. This can be done with the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ couchbase\-cli node\-init \-c 192.168.1.5 \-\-node\-init\-hostname cb1.mydomain.com \(rs
   \-\-node\-init\-data\-path /mnt2/data \-\-node\-init\-index\-path /mnt1/indexes \(rs
   \-\-node\-init\-analytics\-path /mnt3/analytics \(rs
   \-\-node\-init\-java\-home /usr/lib/java/
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Again, note that you don\(cqt need the username and password because in this example
the cluster has not yet been initialized.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
