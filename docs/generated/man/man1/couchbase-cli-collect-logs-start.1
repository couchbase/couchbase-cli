.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command collects all Couchbase Server log files from one or more nodes in
the cluster. Log collection is useful when there are failures in the cluster and
you need to figure out what is going on. Since there are many log files on
various different server the collect\-logs\-start command helps in aggregating all
of the different log file Couchbase Server creates.
.sp
To get the location of the collected log files you can run the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-collect\-logs\-status\fP(1) command either while the log collection task
is running or after the log collection task has completed. If the \-\-upload flag
is specified then the logs will also be uploaded to the host specified in the
\-\-upload\-host flag. The upload flag is intended for Couchbase Server
Enterprise Edition users who need to upload logs to the Couchbase Support Team
to aid in diagnosing support tickets that they have filed.
.sp
Note that only one log collection task may be running at any given time in the
cluster.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-all\-nodes
.RS 4
Specifies that log collection should take place on all nodes in the cluster.
May not be specified at the same time as \-\-nodes.
.RE
.sp
\-\-nodes <node_list>
.RS 4
A list of one or more nodes to collect logs from, the nodes must include the
administrator port. The nodes should be  comma separated. This option may
not be specified at the same time as the \-\-all\-nodes option.
.RE
.sp
\-\-redaction\-level <level>
.RS 4
Specifies what level the logs should be redacted too. This option has two
levels "none" and "partial". If partial is set then data such as
usernames, keys and values will be redacted from the logs. If none is set
then no data  will be redacted. Please note that increasing the level
of redaction can have an impact on debugging problems.
.RE
.sp
\-\-salt <string>
.RS 4
Specifies the string to used as the salt. This option can only be used
when \-\-redaction\-level is set to "partial". The salt is used to increase
the security of the redacted log files. If the option is not specified
then a salt is generated each time the logs are collected. It is important
to specify the salt if logs are from multiple collections or logs from client
SDKs have to be cross referenced against each other.
.RE
.sp
\-\-output\-directory <directory>
.RS 4
Specifies the directory on the node to place the logs. This is the location
where the logs will be placed after collection has finished. Log collection
will fail for the nodes that do not have this directory. It will also fail
if the directory does not have enough space.
.RE
.sp
\-\-temporary\-directory <directory>
.RS 4
Specifies the temporary directory on the node to use while generating the
logs. During log collection a number of temporary files are created before
being compressed. If this temporary location does not have enough space
log collection will fail. All nodes in the cluster must have this
directory. When it is not specified then the operating system temporary
directory will be used.
.RE
.sp
\-\-upload
.RS 4
Specifies that the logs should be uploaded to the host specified with
the \-\-upload\-host option. This option should be used by Couchbase Server
Enterprise customers when uploading logs for the Couchbase Support Team.
.RE
.sp
\-\-upload\-proxy <host>
.RS 4
Specifies the proxy to use when uploading logs. This is useful when a
cluster is deployed in secure environments and do not have a direct
outbound connection to the internet to upload logs.
.RE
.sp
\-\-upload\-host <host>
.RS 4
Once log collection is completed, the logs zip file should be uploaded to
this URL. This parameter is required if the \-\-upload flag is specified.
.RE
.sp
\-\-customer <name>
.RS 4
The name of the customer who is uploading these logs. This option is
required if the \-\-upload flag is specified.
.RE
.sp
\-\-ticket <num>
.RS 4
The ticket number that the support team has created to track the issue
filed. This parameter is optional when specifying the \-\-upload flag, but
recommended if you have a ticket number.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To collect logs on all nodes without uploading them run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli collect\-logs\-start \-c 192.168.1.5 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-all\-nodes
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If there is a three node cluster with IP addresses 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, and
192.168.1.7 and you only want to collect logs on the first two nodes and don\(cqt
want to upload the logs then run the command below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli collect\-logs\-start \-c 192.168.1.5 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-nodes 192.168.1.5:8091,192.168.1.6:8091
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If you are a Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition user and you need to upload logs
for all nodes for a support ticket then you can run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli collect\-logs\-start \-c 192.168.1.5 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-all\-nodes \-\-upload \-\-customer customer_name \(rs
 \-\-upload\-host s3.amazonaws.com/cb\-customers \-\-ticket 12345
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
