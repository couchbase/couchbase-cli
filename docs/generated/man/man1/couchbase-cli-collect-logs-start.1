.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command collects all Couchbase Server log files from one or more nodes in
the cluster. Log collection is useful when there are failures in the cluster and
you need to figure out what is going on. Since there are many log files on
various different server the collect\-logs\-start command helps in aggregating all
of the different log file Couchbase Server creates.
.sp
To get the location of the collected log files you can run the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-collect\-logs\-status\fP(1) command either while the log collection task
is running or after the log collection task has completed. If the \-\-upload flag
is specified then the logs will also be uploaded to the host specified in the
\-\-upload\-host flag. The upload flag is intended for Couchbase Server
Enterprise Edition users who need to upload logs to the Couchbase Support Team
to aid in diagnosing support tickets that they have filed.
.sp
Note that only one log collection task may be running at any given time in the
cluster.
.SH "OPTIONS"

environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
