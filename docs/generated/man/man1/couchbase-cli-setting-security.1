.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command allows configuring cluster wide security settings.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-get
.RS 4
Gets current security settings.
.RE
.sp
\-\-set
.RS 4
Set new security settings.
.RE
.sp
\-\-disable\-http\-ui <0|1>
.RS 4
Specifies whether the Couchbase Web Console can be accessible
over http. To disable access set this option to "1". To enable access
set this option to "0". By default, access to the UI over http is
enabled.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-encryption\-level <all|control>
.RS 4
Specifies the cluster encryption level. The level is used when cluster
encryption is turned on. If the level is "all" then both data
and control messages between the nodes in the cluster will be sent over
encrypted connections. If the level is "control" only control messages will
be sent encrypted. By default when cluster encryption is turned on, the
level will be "control".
.RE
.sp
\-\-tls\-min\-version <tlsv1|tlsv1.1|tlsv1.2>
.RS 4
Specify the minimum TLS protocol version to be used across all of the
Couhbase services.
.RE
.sp
\-\-tls\-honor\-cipher\-order <1|0>
.RS 4
Specifies whether the cipher\-order must be followed across all of the
services. When set to 1, this allows weaker ciphers to be included in the
cipher list for backwards compatibility of older clients/browsers while still
forcing the newer clients to use stronger ciphers.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cipher\-suites <cipher>
.RS 4
Specify the cipher suite to be used across all of the couchbase services.
The ciphers have to be a comma separated list such as:
"TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA", "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA",
"TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA". If an empty string is given ("")
then the cipher list will be reset to its default.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To disable the Couchbase Administration Console over HTTP run the following
command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-security \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-disable\-http\-ui 1
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To change the encryption level to "all" run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-security \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-cluster\-encryption\-level all
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
