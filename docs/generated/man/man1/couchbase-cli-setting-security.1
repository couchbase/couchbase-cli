.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command allows configuring cluster wide security settings.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert <path>
.RS 4
The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a
cluster. May be supplied with \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP as an alternative to the
\f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP flags.  See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION
section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag, when
using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12
format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key <path>
.RS 4
The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the
certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag. May be supplied with
\f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP as an alternative to the \f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP
flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the key provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP flag, when using this
flag, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format.  See the CERTIFICATE
AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-get
.RS 4
Gets current security settings.
.RE
.sp
\-\-set
.RS 4
Set new security settings.
.RE
.sp
\-\-disable\-http\-ui <0|1>
.RS 4
Specifies whether the Couchbase Web Console can be accessible
over http. To disable access set this option to "1". To enable access
set this option to "0". By default, access to the UI over http is
enabled.
.RE
.sp
\-\-disable\-www\-authenticate <0|1>
.RS 4
Specifies whether Couchbase Server will respond with WWW\-Authenticate to
unauthenticated requests. By default this is enabled which may result
in browsers prompting the user for username/password and then caching
the information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-encryption\-level <all|control|strict>
.RS 4
Specifies the cluster encryption level. The level is used when cluster
encryption is turned on. If the level is "all" then both data
and control messages between the nodes in the cluster will be sent over
encrypted connections. If the level is "control" only control messages will
be sent encrypted. If the level is "strict" it is the same as having the
level "all" but all non\-TLS ports on non\-loopback interfaces will be closed.
By default when cluster encryption is turned on, the level will be "control".
.RE
.sp
\-\-tls\-min\-version <tlsv1|tlsv1.1|tlsv1.2>
.RS 4
Specify the minimum TLS protocol version to be used across all of the
Couchbase services.
.RE
.sp
\-\-tls\-honor\-cipher\-order <1|0>
.RS 4
Specifies whether the cipher\-order must be followed across all of the
services. When set to 1, this allows weaker ciphers to be included in the
cipher list for backwards compatibility of older clients/browsers while still
forcing the newer clients to use stronger ciphers.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cipher\-suites <cipher>
.RS 4
Specify the cipher suite to be used across all of the couchbase services.
The ciphers have to be a comma separated list such as:
\f(CRTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\fP.
If an empty string is given ("") then the cipher list will be reset to its default.
.RE
.sp
\-\-hsts\-max\-age <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the max\-ages directive in seconds the server uses in the Strict\-Transport\-Security
header.
.RE
.sp
\-\-hsts\-preload\-enabled <1|0>
.RS 4
Specifies whether the preload directive for the Strict\-Transport\-Security header the server uses
should be set.
.RE
.sp
\-\-hsts\-include\-sub\-domains\-enabled <1|0>
.RS 4
Specifies whether the includeSubDomains directive for the Strict\-Transport\-Security header the
server uses should be set.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
