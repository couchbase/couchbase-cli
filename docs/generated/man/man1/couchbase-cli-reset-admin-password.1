.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to reset the built\-in Couchbase Server Administrator password.
There is only one built\-in Administrator account, which is managed separately
from the internal and external Administrator users.
External and Internal Administrator
accounts can be managed using the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-user\-manage\fP(1) command.
.sp
The \f(CRreset\-admin\-password\fP command must be run locally on a node that is part of the
cluster (i.e. must connect to the host the command is run on).
This is required as \f(CRreset\-admin\-password\fP
relies on a local authentication token, which is used to authenticate with the
server and change the password. As a result, the command does not require
credentials to be passed.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specfies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-\-new\-password <password>
.RS 4
Sets the password for the Couchbase Server administrator user to the value
      specified by the argument. If no password is
specified, the command prompts the user for the new
password through non\-echoed stdin.
.RE
.sp
\-\-regenerate
.RS 4
Sets the password for the Couchbase Server administrator user to a randomly
generated value. The new password is printed to the command line after
the password is changed.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To change the administrator password to \fInew_pwd\fP run the following command:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli reset\-admin\-password \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \(rs
 \-\-new\-password new_pwd
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To change the administrator password to a randomly generated value, run the
following command. The new password will be printed to stdout if the
password is successfully changed:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli reset\-admin\-password \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-regenerate
