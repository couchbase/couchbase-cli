.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to check the status of the log collection task that is
either currently running or last completed. This command is especially useful
since it lists the exact location of the collected files on each node. Upon a
successful run of this command the output will either be one of the two messages
below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
No log collection tasks were found
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
or
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
Status: <running | cancelled | completed>
Details:
  Node: <node name>
  Status: <started | collected>
  path: <path to the location of the collected logs>
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If logs for multiple nodes were collected, then multiple nodes will be listed in
the details section.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
