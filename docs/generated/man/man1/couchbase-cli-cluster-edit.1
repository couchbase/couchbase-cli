.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
DEPRECATED: Please use the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-setting\-cluster\fP(1) command
which provides the same functionality as this command.
.sp
This command is used to modify cluster level settings. It allows users to change
the Couchbase Server built\-in administrator username and password, change the port
that the cluster manager listens on, and modify the data, index, and full\-text
service memory quotas.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-username
.RS 4
Specifies the new username for the Couchbase Server administrator user.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-password
.RS 4
Specifies the new password for the Couchbase Server administrator user.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the data service memory quota (in MB). This quota will be assigned
to all future nodes added to the cluster with the data service.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-fts\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the full\-text service memory quota (in MB). This parameter is required
if the full\-text service is specified in the \-\-services option. This quota
will be assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the full\-text
service.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-index\-ramsize
.RS 4
Sets the index service memory quota (in MB). This parameter is required if
the index service is specified in the \-\-services option. This quota will be
assigned to all future nodes added to the cluster with the index service.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-name
.RS 4
Sets the name for this cluster. Naming clusters is useful when you have
multiple Couchbase Server clusters in your deployment.
.RE
.sp
\-\-cluster\-port
.RS 4
Specifies the port for the Couchbase Server Administration Console. Defaults
to port 8091.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To change the username and password of the Couchbase Server administrator user run
the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-edit \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username current_user \(rs
 \-\-password current_password \-\-cluster\-username new_username \(rs
 \-\-cluster\-password new_password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To change the port number that the cluster manager listens on and the cluster
name to "new_name" run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-edit \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-cluster\-port 5000 \-\-cluster\-name new_name
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To change the memory quota of the data service to 2048MB and the memory quota of
the index service to 4096MB run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-edit \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-cluster\-ramsize 2048 \-\-cluster\-index\-ramsize 4096
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
All of the parameters in this command can be specified at the same time. To
change the username and password of the Couchbase Server administrator user, change
the port number to 5000, change the cluster name to "new_name", change the memory
quota of the data service to 2048MB and change the memory quota of the index
service to 4096MB run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli cluster\-edit \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username current_user \(rs
 \-\-password current_password \-\-cluster\-username new_username \(rs
 \-\-cluster\-password new_password \-\-cluster\-port 5000 \(rs
 \-\-cluster\-name new_name \-\-cluster\-ramsize 2048 \-\-cluster\-index\-ramsize 4096
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
