.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command fails over one or more nodes. Nodes can be either hard failed
over or gracefully failed over. A hard failover means that the failover happens
immediately, but risks potential data loss. Graceful failover ensures that
replication is up to date before the node is failed over so that there is no
data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note that if a node is already down
you must perform a hard failover.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert <path>
.RS 4
The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a
cluster. May be supplied with \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP as an alternative to the
\f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP flags.  See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION
section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag, when
using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12
format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key <path>
.RS 4
The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the
certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag. May be supplied with
\f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP as an alternative to the \f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP
flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the key provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP flag, when using this
flag, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format.  See the CERTIFICATE
AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-failover <server_list>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of nodes to failover.
.RE
.sp
\-\-hard
.RS 4
Specifying this flag signifies that the nodes to be failed over should be
hard failed over. A hard failover means that the failover is immediate, but
you risk potential data loss. If this flag is not specified then a graceful
failover will occur which ensures that the replication is up to date. This
means there will be no data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note
that if a server is already down you must hard fail it over.
.RE
.sp
\-\-force
.RS 4
Specifying this flag forces a hard failover. This option should should only
be used when needed. To be able to do a failover the cluster need a quorum
of nodes. There are case where the majority of nodes are unavailable and it
will be impossible to get a quorum. In those case this flag can be used to
force a hard failover. This flag has to be used with \*(Aq\-\-hard\*(Aq flag.
.RE
.sp
\-\-no\-progress\-bar
.RS 4
Disables showing the progress bar which tracks the progress of the
rebalance. Note that a rebalance only occurs for graceful failovers (e.g.
non\-forced failovers). The failover command will still wait for rebalance
completion even if this flag is specified, but the progress bar will not
be shown.
.RE
.sp
\-\-no\-wait
.RS 4
Specifies that this command should not wait for the completion of rebalance
before exiting. Note that a rebalance only occurs for graceful failovers
(e.g. non\-forced failovers).
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/PEM OR DER ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
