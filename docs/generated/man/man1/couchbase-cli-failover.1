.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command fails over one or more nodes. Nodes can be either hard failed
over or gracefully failed over. A hard failover means that the failover happens
immediately, but risks potential data loss. Graceful failover ensures that
replication is up to date before the node is failed over so that there is no
data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note that if a node is already down
you must perform a hard failover.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-failover <server_list>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of nodes to failover.
.RE
.sp
\-\-force
.RS 4
Specifying this flag signifies that the nodes to be failed over should be
hard failed over. A hard failover means that the failover is immediate, but
you risk potential data loss. If this flag is not specified then the
failover will occur only once replication is up to date. This means there
will be no data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note that if a
server is already down you must hard fail it over.
.RE
.sp
\-\-no\-progress\-bar
.RS 4
Disables showing the progress bar which tracks the progress of the
rebalance. Note that a rebalance only occurs for graceful failovers (e.g.
non\-forced failovers). The failover command will still wait for rebalance
completion even if this flag is specified, but the progress bar will not
be shown.
.RE
.sp
\-\-no\-wait
.RS 4
Specifies that this command should not wait for the completion of rebalance
before exiting. Note that a rebalance only occurs for graceful failovers
(eg. non\-forced failovers).
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To hard fail over two nodes run the following command:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli failover \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \(rs
 \-\-server\-failover 192.168.1.6:8091,192.168.1.7:8091 \-\-force
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To gracefully failover a node run the following command:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli failover \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-failover 192.168.1.6:8091
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
