.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Auditing is used to observe the action of users in the cluster. It is usually
turned on for security purposes to ensure that those without permission to
access information do not access it. By default auditing is disabled in
Couchbase. The setting\-audit command can be used to enable and disable auditing,
set the auditing log path, and change the auditing log rotation interval;
the command can also be used to retrieve the current auditing configuration,
retrieve the auditable events and descriptions,
and disable auditing for certain users and events.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-list\-filterable\-events
.RS 4
Returns a table or a JSON list (if \-\-output json used) with all the event
IDs with there descriptions.
.RE
.sp
\-\-get\-settings
.RS 4
Returns the current audit settings including which events are disabled and
which are enabled.
.RE
.sp
\-\-set
.RS 4
Sets the cluster audit settings.
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-enabled <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not auditing is enabled. To enabled auditing set this
option to "1". To disable auditing set this option to "0".
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-path <path>
.RS 4
Specifies the auditing log path. This should be a path to a
folder where the auditing log is kept. The folder must exist on all servers
in the cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-rotate\-interval <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the audit log rotate interval. This is the interval in which the
current audit log will be replaced with a new empty audit log file. The log
file is rotated to ensure that the audit log does not consume too much disk
space. The minimum audit log rotate interval is 15 minutes (900 seconds).
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-rotate\-size <bytes>
.RS 4
Specifies the audit log rotate size. This is the size at which the current
audit log will be replaced with a new empty audit log file. The log
file is rotated to ensure that the audit log does not consume too much disk
space. The minimum audit log rotate size is 0 bytes and maximum is
524,288,000 (500MB). When it is set to 0 the log will not be rotated based
on size.
.RE
.sp
\-\-disabled\-users <user\-list>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of users to ignore events from.
.RE
.sp
\-\-disable\-events <events\-list>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of events IDs to disable auditing for
(e.g 8243,8255,8257). To retrieve information of what event ID maps to
what event use the \-\-list\-filterable\-events to retrieve a list of IDs with
descriptions.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To get the current audit settings run the command below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

$ couchbase\-cli setting\-audit \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-get\-settings
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If auditing is disabled the expected output will be of the form (all the
commands can return json if \f(CR\-\-output json\fP is provided):
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
Audit enabled: False
UUID: 44726500
