.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Auditing is used to observe the action of users in the cluster. It is usually
turned on for security purposes to ensure that those without permission to
access information do not access it. By default auditing is disabled in
Couchbase. The setting\-audit command can be used to enable and disable auditing,
set the auditing log path, and change the auditing log rotation interval;
the command can also be used to retrieve the current auditing configuration,
retrieve the auditable events and descriptions,
and disable auditing for certain users and events.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert <path>
.RS 4
The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a
cluster. May be supplied with \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP as an alternative to the
\f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP flags.  See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION
section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag, when
using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12
format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key <path>
.RS 4
The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the
certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag. May be supplied with
\f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP as an alternative to the \f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP
flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the key provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP flag, when using this
flag, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format.  See the CERTIFICATE
AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-list\-filterable\-events
.RS 4
Returns a table or a JSON list (if \-\-output json used) with all the event
IDs with there descriptions.
.RE
.sp
\-\-get\-settings
.RS 4
Returns the current audit settings including which events are disabled and
which are enabled.
.RE
.sp
\-\-set
.RS 4
Sets the cluster audit settings.
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-enabled <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not auditing is enabled. To enabled auditing set this
option to "1". To disable auditing set this option to "0".
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-path <path>
.RS 4
Specifies the auditing log path. This should be a path to a
folder where the auditing log is kept. The folder must exist on all servers
in the cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-rotate\-interval <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the audit log rotate interval. This is the interval in which the
current audit log will be replaced with a new empty audit log file. The log
file is rotated to ensure that the audit log does not consume too much disk
space. The minimum audit log rotate interval is 15 minutes (900 seconds).
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-rotate\-size <bytes>
.RS 4
Specifies the audit log rotate size. This is the size at which the current
audit log will be replaced with a new empty audit log file. The log
file is rotated to ensure that the audit log does not consume too much disk
space. The minimum audit log rotate size is 0 bytes and maximum is
524,288,000 (500MiB). When it is set to 0 the log will not be rotated based
on size.
.RE
.sp
\-\-disabled\-users <user\-list>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of users to ignore events from. Local RBAC usernames
should be postfixed with \f(CR/local\fP, external LDAP users should be postfixed
with \f(CR/external\fP.
.RE
.sp
\-\-disable\-events <events\-list>
.RS 4
A comma separated list of events IDs to disable auditing for
(e.g 8243,8255,8257). To retrieve information of what event ID maps to
what event use the \-\-list\-filterable\-events to retrieve a list of IDs with
descriptions.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
