.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Auditing is used to observe the action of users in the cluster. It is usually
turned on for security purposes to ensure that those without permission to
access information do not access it. By default auditing is disabled in
Couchbase. The setting\-audit command can be used to enable auditing, set the
auditing log path, and change the auditing log rotation interval.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-enabled <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not auditing is enabled. To enabled auditing set this
option to "1". To disable auditing set this option to "0".
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-path <path>
.RS 4
Specifies The auditing log path. This should be a path should be a path to a
folder where the auditing log is kept. The folder must exist on all servers
in the cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-rotate\-interval <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the audit log rotate interval. This is the interval in which the
current audit log will be replaced with a new empty audit log file. The log
file is rotated to ensure that the audit log does not consume too much disk
space. The minimum audit log rotate interval is 15 minutes (900 seconds).
.RE
.sp
\-\-audit\-log\-rotate\-size <bytes>
.RS 4
Specifies the audit log rotate size. This is the size at which the current
audit log will be replaced with a new empty audit log file. The log
file is rotated to ensure that the audit log does not consume too much disk
space. The minimum audit log rotate size is 0 bytes and maximum is
524,288,000 (500MB). When it is set to 0 the log will not be rotated based
on size.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To enable auditing on a cluster and set the audit log to the default logs folder
on a linux installation with a log rotate interval of 7 days run the command
below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-audit \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-enabled 1 \-\-audit\-log\-rotate\-interval 604800 \(rs
 \-\-audit\-log\-path /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To enable auditing on a cluster and set the audit log to the default logs folder
on a linux installation with a log rotate size of 20MB run the command below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-audit \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-enabled 1 \-\-audit\-log\-rotate\-size 20971520 \(rs
 \-\-audit\-log\-path /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To disable auditing run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-audit \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-enabled 1
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
