.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to set the alternate address for a node. This alternate address
allows the node to be connected by a different address, this is useful when an external
agent tries to connect via a NAT\(cqd environment such as the cloud or kubernetes.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-list
.RS 4
Show current alternate addresses
.RE
.sp
\-\-set
.RS 4
Set alternate address for the node specified in the \-c/\-\-cluster option.
.RE
.sp
\-\-remove
.RS 4
Remove alternate address for the node specified in the \-c/\-\-cluster option.
.RE
.sp
\-\-node <node>
.RS 4
The node in the cluster to take action on. This is required when using
\-\-set or \-\-remove flags.
.RE
.sp
\-\-hostname <host>
.RS 4
Alternate host address
.RE
.sp
\-\-ports <port>
.RS 4
Alternate port mappings. Specified as a comma separated list: e.g. \-\-ports
kv=9000,kvSSL=9999.

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To set the alternate address and custom ports for node 192.168.1.5 we would use the
following command:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-alternate\-address \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-set \-\-node 192.168.1.5 \-\-hostname 10.10.10.10 \(rs
 \-\-ports mgmt=1100,capi=2000,capiSSL=3000
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To see the current alternate address configuration we would use the \-\-list flag as
follows:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-alternate\-address \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-list
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
All of the ports that can be configured:
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
