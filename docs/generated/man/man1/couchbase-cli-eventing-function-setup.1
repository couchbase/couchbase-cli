When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/PEM OR DER ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA

.SH "UNDEPLOY VS PAUSE"
.sp
Once you undeploy an eventing function you will have no opportunity to resume
from the point at which the function was undeployed; this is not the case for
pause/resume. Pausing an eventing function allows you to make changes to it
or its settings while retaining the ability to continue from the point at
which the function was paused.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
