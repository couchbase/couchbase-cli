.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Auto\-failover allows unresponsive servers to be failed over automatically by the
cluster manager. Data partitions in Couchbase are always served from a single
master node. As a result if a server is down in the cluster data from that
server will be not be available while that server is down. The server will
either need to be manually or automatically failed over in order to promote
replica data partitions on replica servers to active data partitions so that
they can be accessed by the application.
.sp
Since the administrator will not always be able to manually fail servers over
quickly enough to avoid application down time Couchbase provides an
auto\-failover feature. This feature allows the cluster manager to automatically
fail over down nodes over and bring the cluster back to a healthy state as
quickly as possible.
.sp
In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition nodes can also be automatically failed
over when the Data Service reports sustained disk I/O failures.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-auto\-failover <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not autofailover is enabled. Set this option to "1" to
enable autofailover or "0" to disable autofailover.
.RE
.sp
\-\-auto\-failover\-timeout <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the auto\-failover timeout. This is the amount of time a node must
be unresponsive before the cluster manager considers the node to be down and
fails it over. The minimum auto\-failover timeout is 30 seconds in Couchbase
Community Edition and 5 seconds in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-max\-failovers <num>
.RS 4
Specifies the number of auto\-failover events that will be handled before
requiring user intervention. A single event could be one node failing over or
an entire Server Group. The maximum allowed value is three. This feature is
only available in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-failover\-of\-server\-groups <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not auto\-failover can failover entire Server Groups.
This feature is only available in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-failover\-on\-data\-disk\-issues <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not autofailover on Data Service disk issues is enabled.
Set this option to "1" to enable failover on Data Service disk issue or
"0" to disable it. "\-\-failover\-data\-disk\-period" needs to be set at the
same time when enabling this option. This feature is only available in
Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-failover\-data\-disk\-period <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the failover data disk period. This is the period of time over
which the Data Service is checked for potential sustained Disk I/O
failures. The Data Service is checked every second for disk failures. If
60% of the checks during that time period report disk failures, then the
node may be automatically failed over.
"\-\-enable\-failover\-on\-data\-disk\-issues" must be set when this option is
used. The failover data disk period ranges from 5 to 3600 seconds.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
