.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Auto\-failover allows unresponsive servers to be failed over automatically by the
cluster manager. Data partitions in Couchbase are always served from a single
master node. As a result if a server is down in the cluster data from that
server will be not be available while that server is down. The server will
either need to be manually or automatically failed over in order to promote
replica data partitions on replica servers to active data partitions so that
they can be accessed by the application.
.sp
Since the administrator will not always be able to manually fail servers over
quickly enough to avoid application down time Couchbase provides an
auto\-failover feature. This feature allows the cluster manager to automatically
fail over down nodes over and bring the cluster back to a healthy state as
quickly as possible.
.sp
In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition nodes can also be automatically failed
over when the Data Service reports sustained disk I/O failures.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert <path>
.RS 4
The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a
cluster. May be supplied with \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP as an alternative to the
\f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP flags.  See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION
section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag, when
using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12
format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key <path>
.RS 4
The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the
certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag. May be supplied with
\f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP as an alternative to the \f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP
flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the key provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP flag, when using this
flag, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format.  See the CERTIFICATE
AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-auto\-failover <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not autofailover is enabled. Set this option to "1" to
enable autofailover or "0" to disable autofailover.
.RE
.sp
\-\-auto\-failover\-timeout <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the auto\-failover timeout. This is the amount of time a node must
be unresponsive before the cluster manager considers the node to be down and
fails it over. The minimum auto\-failover timeout is 30 seconds in Couchbase
Community Edition and 5 seconds in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-max\-failovers <num>
.RS 4
Specifies the number of auto\-failover events that will be handled before
requiring user intervention. A single event could be one node failing over or
an entire Server Group. The maximum allowed value is three. This feature is
only available in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-failover\-of\-server\-groups <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not auto\-failover can failover entire Server Groups.
This feature is only available in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-failover\-on\-data\-disk\-issues <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not autofailover on Data Service disk issues is enabled.
Set this option to "1" to enable failover on Data Service disk issue or
"0" to disable it. "\-\-failover\-data\-disk\-period" needs to be set at the
same time when enabling this option. This feature is only available in
Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-failover\-data\-disk\-period <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the failover data disk period. This is the period of time over
which the Data Service is checked for potential sustained Disk I/O
failures. The Data Service is checked every second for disk failures. If
60% of the checks during that time period report disk failures, then the
node may be automatically failed over.
"\-\-enable\-failover\-on\-data\-disk\-issues" must be set when this option is
used. The failover data disk period ranges from 5 to 3600 seconds.
.RE
.sp
\-\-can\-abort\-rebalance <1|0>
.RS 4
Enables auto\-failover to abort rebalance and perform auto\-failover.
This feature is only available in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/PEM OR DER ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
