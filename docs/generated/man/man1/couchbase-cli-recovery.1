.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
When a server is failed over and removed from the cluster it may only be able to
be added back to the cluster. And example of this is when a server loses power.
This server might get failed over and removed from the cluster, but once power
is restored to the server you may want to add it back to the cluster.
.sp
Another use case is taking a server out of the cluster for maintenance. This
is done by gracefully failing over a server to ensure there is no data loss.
The administrator can then perform maintenance on the removed server and add it
back with the recovery command.
.sp
The recovery command also allows a server to have it\(cqs data removed before being
added back to the cluster (full recovery) or having the server resume from where
it last left off (delta recovery). Delta recovery will always take the least
amount of time and is the recommended recovery mode.
.sp
Note that after the recovery subcommand is run you must rebalance the
cluster. See the \fBcouchbase\-cli\-rebalance\fP(1) command for more information
on rebalancing a cluster.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert <path>
.RS 4
The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a
cluster. May be supplied with \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP as an alternative to the
\f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP flags.  See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION
section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag, when
using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12
format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key <path>
.RS 4
The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the
certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag. May be supplied with
\f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP as an alternative to the \f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP
flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the key provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP flag, when using this
flag, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format.  See the CERTIFICATE
AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-server\-recovery <servers>
.RS 4
A command separated list of servers to recover. The each server should
correspond to the hostname or IP address of a server to be added back to
the cluster.
.RE
.sp
\-\-recovery\-type <type>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not we should do full or delta recovery of data on the
servers being added back. Full recover means that all data on the servers
being recovered will be removed and we will recover all data. Specifying
delta recover means we will keep the data that is on each server and only
recover the data that each server doesn\(cqt have. To specify full recovery set
this option to "full". For delta recovery set this option to "delta". The
default value for this option is "full".
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
