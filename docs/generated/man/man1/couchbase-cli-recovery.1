.SH "NAME"
couchbase-cli-recovery \- Recovers a previously failed over node
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIcouchbase\-cli recovery\fR [\-\-cluster <url>] [\-\-username <username>]
          [\-\-password <password>] [\-\-server\-recovery <servers>]
          [\-\-recovery\-type <type>]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
When a server is failed over and removed from the cluster it may only be able to be added back to the cluster\&. And example of this is when a server loses power\&. This server might get failed over and removed from the cluster, but once power is restored to the server you may want to add it back to the cluster\&.
.sp
Another use case is taking a server out of the cluster for maintenance\&. This is done by gracefully failing over a server to ensure there is no data loss\&. The administrator can then perform maintenance on the removed server and add it back with the server\-readd command\&.
.sp
The recovery command also allows a server to have it\(cqs data remvoed before being added back to the cluster (full recovery) or having the server resume from where it last left off (delta recovery)\&. Delta recovery will always take the least amount of time and is the recommended recovery mode\&.
.sp
Note that after the recovery subcommand is run you must rebalance the cluster\&. See the \fBcouchbase-rebalance\fR(1) command for more information on rebalancing a cluster\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster\&. See the HOST FORMATS section for more information on specifying a hostname\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command\&. If you do not have a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. If you do not have a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with an unauthorized error\&. If this argument is specified, but no password is given then the command will prompt the user for a password through non\-echoed stdin\&. You may also specify your password by using the environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-server\-recovery <servers>
.RS 4
A command separated list of servers to recover\&. The each server should correspond to the hostname or IP address of a server to be added back to the cluster\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-recovery\-type <type>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not we should do full or delta recovery of data on the servers being added back\&. Full recover means that all data on the servers being recovered will be removed and we will recover all data\&. Specifying delta recover means we will keep the data that is on each server and only recover the data that each server doesn\(cqt have\&. To specify full recovery set this option to "full"\&. For delta recovery set this option to "delta"\&. The default value for this option is "full"\&.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
couchbase://<addr>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
http://<addr>:<port>
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard installations\&. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on a port other that 8091\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
If we have a server at 192\&.168\&.1\&.6:8091 that we want to recover and we want to recover data using delta recovery then we can run the following command\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-readd \-c 192\&.168\&.1\&.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-recovery 192\&.168\&.1\&.6:8091 \e
 \-\-recovery\-type delta
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If we need to recover multiple servers then we would run the following command\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-readd \-c 192\&.168\&.1\&.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-recovery 192\&.168\&.1\&.6:8091,192\&.168\&.1\&.7:8091 \e
 \-\-recovery\-type delta
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If we wanted the servers being recovered to use full recovery then we would run the following command\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli server\-readd \-c 192\&.168\&.1\&.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \e
 \-\-password password \-\-server\-recovery 192\&.168\&.1\&.6:8091 \e
 \-\-recovery\-type full
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME Specifies the username to use when executing the command\&. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username argument on the command line\&.
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD Specifies the password of the user executing the command\&. This environment variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password argument on the command line\&. It also allows the user to ensure that their password are not cached in their command line history\&.
