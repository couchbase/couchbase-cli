.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Modifies the settings of the bucket specified. Note that some settings can be
applied immediately, while other settings either require a rebalance, or require
the bucket to be restarted; resulting in potential application downtime.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert <path>
.RS 4
The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a
cluster. May be supplied with \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP as an alternative to the
\f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP flags.  See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION
section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag, when
using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12
format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key <path>
.RS 4
The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the
certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag. May be supplied with
\f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP as an alternative to the \f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP
flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the key provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP flag, when using this
flag, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format.  See the CERTIFICATE
AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket <name>
.RS 4
The name of the bucket to edit.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-ramsize <size>
.RS 4
The amount of memory to allocate to the cache for this bucket, in mebibytes.
The memory quota of this bucket must fit into the overall cluster memory
quota. The minimum cache size is 100MiB.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-replica <num>
.RS 4
The number of servers to which data is replicated. Replicas provide
protection against data loss by keeping copies of a bucket\(cqs data on
multiple servers. By default, the number of replicas is one, even if there is
only a single server in the cluster. The minimum number of replicas is zero,
and the maximum three. This option is valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral
buckets only.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-port <num>
.RS 4
Sets the port on which the bucket listens. This parameter is deprecated, and
therefore not recommended for use.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-priority <priority>
.RS 4
Specifies the priority of this bucket\(cqs background tasks. This option is
valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only. For Couchbase buckets,
background task\-types include disk I/O, DCP stream\-processing, and
item\-paging. For Ephemeral buckets, background task\-types are the same as
for Couchbase buckets, with the exception of disk I/O, which does not apply
to Ephemeral buckets. The value of this option may be "high" or "low". The
default is "low". Specifying "high" may result in faster processing; but
only when more than one bucket is defined for the cluster, and when
different priority settings have been established among the buckets. When
Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets have different priority settings, this
affects the prioritization only of task\-types other than disk I/O.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-eviction\-policy <policy>
.RS 4
The memory\-cache eviction policy for this bucket. This option is valid for
Couchbase buckets only; the eviction policy for ephemeral buckets can\(cqt be
changed.
.sp
Couchbase buckets support either "valueOnly" or "fullEviction". Specifying
the "valueOnly" policy means that each key stored in this bucket must be
kept in memory. This is the default policy: using this policy improves
performance of key\-value operations, but limits the maximum size of the
bucket. Specifying the "fullEviction" policy means that performance is
impacted for key\-value operations, but the maximum size of the bucket is
unbounded.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-flush <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not the flush operation is allowed for this bucket. To
enable flushing, set this option to "1". To disable flushing, set this
option to "0". By default, flushing is disabled.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-index\-replica <num>
.RS 4
Enables view index replication for the current bucket. This option is valid
for Couchbase buckets only. To enable, set the value of this option to "1".
To disable, set the value of this option to "0". By default, view index
replication is disabled. There may be at most one replica view index.
.RE
.sp
\-\-max\-ttl <seconds>
.RS 4
Specifies the maximum TTL (time\-to\-live) for all documents in
bucket in seconds. If enabled and a document is mutated with no TTL
or a TTL greater than than the maximum, its TTL will be set to the
maximum TTL. Setting this option to 0 disables the use of max\-TTL
and the largest TTL that is allowed is 2147483647. This option is
only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase
Enterprise Edition.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compression\-mode <mode>
.RS 4
Specifies the compression\-mode of the bucket. There are three options;
off, passive and active. All three modes are backwards compatible with
older SDKs, where Couchbase Server will automatically uncompress documents
for clients that do not understand the compression being used. This option
is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase
Enterprise Edition.
.sp
Off: Couchbase Server will only compress document values when persisting to
disk. This is suitable for use cases where compression could have a
negative impact on performance. Please note it is expected that compression
in most use cases will improve performance.
.sp
Passive: Documents which were compressed by a client, or read compressed
from disk will be stored compress in\-memory. Couchbase Server will make
no additional attempt to compress documents that are not already compressed.
.sp
Active: Couchbase Server will actively and aggressively attempt to compress
documents, even if they have not been received in a compressed format. This
provides the benefits of compression even when the SDK clients are not
complicit.
.RE
.sp
\-\-remove\-bucket\-port <num>
.RS 4
Removes the bucket\-port setting that might have been set in previous
versions of Couchbase Server. The bucket\-port also knows as the dedicated
port and server side moxi has been deprecated. In later versions of
Couchbase Server a cluster will not be able to upgrade if a bucket has the
dedicated port set. This option allows removal of that setting by setting
it to 1.
.RE
.sp
\-\-database\-fragmentation\-threshold\-percentage <perc>
.RS 4
Sets the database fragmentation trigger threshold as a percentage. Can be set
to values between 2 and 100.
.RE
.sp
\-\-database\-fragmentation\-threshold\-size <mebibytes>
.RS 4
Sets the database fragmentation trigger threshold as a number of mebibytes.
It accepts integers greater than 1.
.RE
.sp
\-\-view\-fragmentation\-threshold\-percentage <perc>
.RS 4
Sets the view fragmentation trigger threshold as a percentage. Can be set
to values between 2 and 100.
.RE
.sp
\-\-view\-fragmentation\-threshold\-size <mebibytes>
.RS 4
Sets the view fragmentation trigger threshold as a number of mebibytes.
It accepts integers greater than 1.
.RE
.sp
\-\-from\-hour <hour>
.RS 4
Sets the hour of the start time. Used together with \(rs\-\(rs\-from\(rs\-minutes to set the
start time of the interval in which compaction is allowed to run. To set the
interval ensure both start and end time are set.
.RE
.sp
\-\-from\-minute <min>
.RS 4
Sets the minute of the start time. Used together with \(rs\-\(rs\-from\(rs\-hour to set the
start time of the interval in which compaction is allowed to run. To set the
interval ensure both start and end time are set.
.RE
.sp
\-\-to\-hour <hour>
.RS 4
Sets the hour of the end time. Used together with \(rs\-\(rs\-to\(rs\-minute to set the
end time of the interval in which compaction is allowed to run. To set the
interval ensure both start and end time are set.
.RE
.sp
\-\-to\-minute <min>
.RS 4
Sets the minute of the end time. Used together with \(rs\-\(rs\-to\(rs\-hour to set the
end time of the interval in which compaction is allowed to run. To set the
interval ensure both start and end time are set.
.RE
.sp
\-\-abort\-outside <0|1>
.RS 4
Will set the option that terminate compaction if the process takes longer than
the allowed time. Options are [1, 0].
.RE
.sp
\-\-parallel\-db\-view\-compaction <0|1>
.RS 4
Run index and data compaction in parallel. Global setting only.
.RE
.sp
\-\-purge\-interval <num>
.RS 4
Sets the frequency of the tombstone (metadata) purge interval. The default
value is three days.
.RE
.sp
\-\-durability\-min\-level <level>
.RS 4
The minimum durability level for the bucket. Accepted values for "ephemeral"
buckets are "none" or "majority". Accepted values for "couchbase" buckets
are "none", "majority", "majorityAndPersistActive", or "persistToMajority".
.sp
"none" specifies mutations to the bucket are asynchronous and offer no
durability guarantees. "majority" specifies mutations must be replicated
to (that is, held in the memory allocated to the bucket on) a majority
of the Data Service nodes. "majorityAndPersistActive" specifies mutations
must be replicated to a majority of the Data Service nodes. Additionally,
it must be written to disk on the node hosting the active vBucket for the
data. "persistToMajority" specifies mutations must be persisted to a
majority of the Data Service nodes. Accordingly, it will be written to disk
on those nodes.

.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
