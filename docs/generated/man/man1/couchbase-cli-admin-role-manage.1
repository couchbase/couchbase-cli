.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To show the current users roles run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli admin\-role\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-my\-roles
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To see a list of all available roles in Couchbase Server run the following
command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli admin\-role\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-get\-roles
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To set roles for a new user "Alice Meyers" with username "alice" and the
cluster administrator and replication administrator roles run the following
command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli admin\-role\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-set\-users alice \-\-set\-names "Alice Meyers" \(rs
 \-\-roles cluster_admin,replication_admin
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
You can also specify multiple users at the same time when using the set users
flag. For example if you want to add Alice Meyers and Barry Dillon to the same
set of roles you could run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli admin\-role\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-set\-users alice,barry \(rs
 \-\-set\-names "Alice Meyers,Barry Dillon" \(rs
 \-\-roles cluster_admin,replication_admin
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To delete the user alice you can run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli admin\-role\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-delete\-users alice
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
You also delete multiple users at the same time. For example if you want to
delete both alic and barry then you can do so by running the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli admin\-role\-manage \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
