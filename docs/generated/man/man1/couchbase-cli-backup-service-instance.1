When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:

.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1

.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\

\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.SS "Retrieving repository information"

You can also filter to only get repositories in certain state by using the \f(CR\-\-state\fP flag. If you want more in\-depth
details for the repository use the JSON output as can be seen below:
.sp
To set the backup service configuration use the \f(CR\-\-set\fP flag and any of the configuration flags for example:
.sp

As before you can retrieve all details in JSON format by using \f(CR\-\-output json\fP before the
repository subcommand.
.SS "Adding and modifying repositories"
.sp
To add an repository one can use the \f(CR\-\-add action\fP flag as shown below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c http://127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  repository \-\-add \-\-id new\-repository \-\-profile _weekly \-\-backup\-archive /backup/service
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
In the command above we are adding a new repository with name \f(CRnew\-repository\fP that is using a
base profile \f(CR_weekly\fP. The base profile defines the schedules of the tasks that the
repository will run as well as what services it will backup. Finally the backup archive is the
location where the backups will stored. This location is equivalent to a cbbackupmgr
archive. Two repository should \fBnot\fP use the same archive. Also \f(CRcbbackupmgr\fP should \fBnot\fP
be run on the archives managed by the service directly.
.sp
If you want an repository that only backs up one bucket or want different backup schedules
for each bucket this can be achieved by using the \f(CR\-\-bucket\-name\fP argument to specify
which bucket the repository should backup. An example can be seen below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c http://127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  repository \-\-add \-\-id new\-repository \-\-profile _weekly \-\-backup\-archive /backup/service \(rs
  \-\-bucket\-name beer\-sample
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The service also supports creating cloud backup repositories. These are repositories that backup
directly to object store. Currently the only supported object store is S3 and S3
compatible stores. To create a cloud repository you will need to supply some more details,
as ilustrated in the example below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli \-c http://127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  repository \-\-add \-\-id cloud\-repository \-\-profile _daily \-\-backup\-archive s3://cloud\-bucket/archive \(rs
  \-\-cloud\-staging\-dir /backup/staging \-\-cloud\-credentials\-id id \-\-cloud\-credentials\-key key \(rs
  \-\-cloud\-credentials\-region us\-east\-1
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
In the command above we can see that the archive supplied for cloud must start with the
schema \f(CRs3://\fP followed by the bucket name, after, the path to the archive in S3 must be
given. A \fBstaging directory\fP must also be supplied. This is a location where cbbackupmgr
will temporarily store data whilst doing cloud backups. This path must be available in
all backup nodes and should have space for roughly 10% of the data set size as reported
by the UI. In the command above we have also supplied the cloud credential ID, key and
region. This are the details that will be used to communicate with S3. Note that
credentials can be stored and reused in the backup service so if you already have
the correct set of credentials stored you can replace the id, key and region flags by
\f(CR\-\-cloud\-credential\-name\fP and give the name of the credential set you want to re\-use.
.sp
Finally, for S3 compatible stores you can use the \f(CR\-\-cloud\-endpoint\fP argument to override
the endpoint use to communicate with S3 and point it to your storage solution address.
Some S3 compatible storages only support the old S3 path styles to use those supply the
\f(CRs3\-force\-path\-style\fP argument.
.sp
To archive an repository you can use the command below. Archiving an repository moves the
repository to read\-only mode. This means that no more backup tasks will be run. The
repository can still be restored and the data examined but not altered. This action is not
reversible.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c http://127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  repository \-\-archive \-\-id active\-repository \-\-new\-id deprecated
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The last way in which can modify an repository is by removing it. Only archived and imported
repositories can be removed. If you want to remove an active repository you first have to
archive it as explained above. To remove an repository use the command below. Note that this
operation cannot be undone.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c http://127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  repository \-\-remove \-\-id repository \-\-state imported
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note that by default this command only removes the repository from the service but does
\fBnot\fP remove the backup repository. The flag \f(CR\-\-remove\-data\fP allows you to also delete
the underlaying data. This argument can only be used with archived repositories as imported
ones could still be in use by another node. To remove the data as well follow the example
below, note that once the data is deleted it cannot be recovered.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c http://127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  repository \-\-remove \-\-id other_repository \-\-state archived \-\-remove\-data

.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
