.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command sets cluster\-wide compaction settings for the views and data
service.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-db\-percentage <num>
.RS 4
Compacts database files once the fragmentation percentage is greater than
the value set for this option. The value must be between 2 and 100.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-db\-size <megabytes>
.RS 4
Compacts the database files once the file fragmentation (in MB) is greater
than the value of this option. This option must be set to a value
greater than 1.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-view\-percentage <num>
.RS 4
Compacts view files once the fragmentation percentage is greater than the
value set for this option. The value must be between 2 and 100.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-view\-size: <megabytes>
.RS 4
Compacts the view files once the file fragmentation (in MB) is greater than
the value of this option. This option must be set to a value greater than 1.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-period\-from <HH:MM>
.RS 4
This option is unison in conjunction with the \-\-compaction\-period\-to option
and is used to specify a time period where compaction is allowed to run. You
could for example specify that compaction should only run between midnight
and 5AM each day by setting the compaction from period to "00:00" and the
compaction to period to "5:00". When setting the value for this option you
must use the format HH:MM when HH corresponds to the hour and MM corresponds
to the minute. If this option is not specified then the compaction will run
at any time of the day. This option only affects view and database file
compaction.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-period\-to <HH:MM>
.RS 4
This option is unison in conjunction with the \-\-compaction\-period\-from option
and is used to specify a time period where compaction is allowed to run. You
could for example specify that compaction should only run between midnight
and 5AM each day by setting the compaction from period to "00:00" and the
compaction to period to "5:00". When setting the value for this option you
must use the format HH:MM when HH corresponds to the hour and MM corresponds
to the minute. If this option is not specified then the compaction will run
at any time of the day. This option only affects view and database file
compaction.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-compaction\-abort <num>
.RS 4
If a compaction from period and compaction to period are specified then this
flag tells the server how to respond if a compaction starts during the
allowed compaction interval and is still running once after the allowed
interval has ended. If this option is set to "1" then the compaction will
be aborted. If it is set to "0" then the compaction will be allowed to
complete. By default this option is set to "0".
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-compaction\-parallel <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether view and database file compaction can run at the same
time. Compaction can be disk intensive operations so it may be beneficial
to only allow one type of compaction to run at a time. To allow parallel
compaction set the value of this option to "1". To disable parallel
compaction set the value of this option to "0". By default this option is
set to "0".
.RE
.sp
\-\-metadata\-purge\-interval <days>
.RS 4
Couchbase persists deletes to disk because these deletes may need to be
replicated in the future during intra\-cluster replication as well as during
Cross Data Center Replication. Couchbase cannot however keep these deletes
forever because they will cause the database disk size to increase
infinitely over time. To combat this issue Couchbase purges old deletes from
disk periodically. This flag allow the user to set this interval. By default
the purge interval is set to 7 days. This means that we purge deletes from
disk that are more than 7 days old. The value of this option must be between
0.04 (1 hour) and 60 (days).
.RE
.sp
\-\-gsi\-compaction\-mode <mode>
.RS 4
Specifies the strategy for compaction in GSI Indexes. This option may be set
to either append or circular. The append compaction strategy works by
creating a new index file, moving the active data to the new index file, and
then removing the old index file. This strategy will cause increased disk
usage during compaction, but will cause the new index file to be smaller
than the old one and as a result will free up disk space. The circular
compaction strategy will append data at first until the index is 65%
fragmented. At which point it will start to write data over old blocks in the
file that are no longer being used. A full compaction will be triggered once a
day on the day set via \-\-compaction\-gsi\-interval.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-gsi\-percentage <percent>
.RS 4
Specifies that GSI compaction should be started when the fragmentation in an
index file has exceeded this percentage. This parameter only applies if the
append compaction mode is used.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-gsi\-interval <list_of_days>
.RS 4
Specifies that GSI compaction should only run on the specified days. This
option takes a comma separated list of days where the name of the day is
capitalized. Accepted values are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. If you only want compaction to run on Monday
and Tuesday then the value of this option should be set to "Monday,Tuesday".
This parameter only applies if circular compaction mode is used.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-gsi\-period\-from <HH:MM>
.RS 4
This option is unison in conjunction with the \-\-compaction\-gsi\-period\-to
option and is used to specify a time period where GSI compaction is allowed
to run. You could for example specify that GSI compaction should only run
between midnight and 5AM each day by setting the GSI compaction from period
to "00:00" and the GSI compaction to period to "5:00". When setting the
value for this option you must use the format HH:MM when HH corresponds to
the hour and MM corresponds to the minute. If this option is not specified
then compaction will run at any time of the day. This parameter only
applies if circular compaction mode is used.
.RE
.sp
\-\-compaction\-gsi\-period\-to <HH:MM>
.RS 4
This option is unison in conjunction with the \-\-compaction\-gsi\-period\-from
option and is used to specify a time period where GSI compaction is allowed
to run. You could for example specify that GSI compaction should only run
between midnight and 5AM each day by setting the GSI compaction from period

.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-gsi\-compaction\-abort <1|0>
.RS 4
If a GSI compaction from period and GSI compaction to period are specified
then this flag tells the server how to respond if a compaction starts during
the allowed GSI compaction interval and is still running after the allowed
interval has ended. If this option is set to "1" then the GSI compaction
will be aborted. If it is set to "0" then the GSI compaction will be allowed
to complete. By default this option is set to "0". This parameter only
applies if circular compaction mode is used.

.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

If we want to set our view and database compaction percentage thresholds to 30%
each, but also wanted to ensure that our fragmentation didn\(cqt grow above 1GB
we would run the following command
.sp
.if n .RS 4

If we want to have the same settings as above, but we wanted compaction to only
run at night so that we didn\(cqt run the risk of compaction affecting normal
application traffic we would run the following command. Note that in this
example we will assume our night time period is midnight to 6AM. We will also
enable compaction aborts so that we can ensure compaction is never running
outside of this time window.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

If we don\(cqt mind when compaction runs and we have the disk overhead to run both
view and database compaction at the same time then we might set up compaction
with the settings in the first example, but also enable parallel compaction.
This can be done by running the command below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

If your application heavily uses expirations or you create and delete a lot of
documents quickly then you might want to shorten your metadata purge interval
in order to ensure that you don\(cqt use too much disk space. If we want our
compaction to run when the fragmentation is 30% or 1GB and we want to change
the metadata purge interval to 2 days then we would run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli setting\-compaction \-c 192.168.1.5 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
