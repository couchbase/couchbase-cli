.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to manage the remote clusters that are available to be
replicated to.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-username <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert <path>
.RS 4
The path to a client certificate used to authenticate when connecting to a
cluster. May be supplied with \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP as an alternative to the
\f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP flags.  See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION
section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag, when
using this flag, the certificate/key pair is expected to be in the PKCS#12
format. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key <path>
.RS 4
The path to the client private key whose public key is contained in the
certificate provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP flag. May be supplied with
\f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP as an alternative to the \f(CR\-\-username\fP and \f(CR\-\-password\fP
flags. See the CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-client\-key\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password for the key provided to the \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP flag, when using this
flag, the key is expected to be in the PKCS#8 format.  See the CERTIFICATE
AUTHENTICATION section for more information.
.RE
.sp
\-\-create
.RS 4
Creates an new XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-delete
.RS 4
Deletes an XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-edit
.RS 4
Edits an XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-list
.RS 4
List all XDCR remote references.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name <name>
.RS 4
The name for the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-hostname <hostname>
.RS 4
The hostname of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-username <username>
.RS 4
The username of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-user\-certificate <path>
.RS 4
The user certificate for authentication
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-user\-key <path>
.RS 4
The user key for authentication
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-certificate <path>
.RS 4
The certificate used for encryption
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-secure\-connection <type>
.RS 4
Specifies the type of encryption to use. This flag may either be set to
either "half", "full", or "none". Half encryption means that passwords are
encrypted, but data is not. This results in faster data transfer, but less
security. Full encryption means that all data and passwords are encrypted
which increases security, but reduces overall data transfer speed. If no
encryption is needed then "none" can be specified. This flag defaults to
"none" if it is not specified.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "CERTIFICATE AUTHENTICATION (MTLS AUTHENTICATION)"
.sp
This tool supports authenticating against a Couchbase Cluster by using certificate based authentication (mTLS
authentication). To use certificate based authentication a certificate/key must be supplied, there a currently
multiple ways this may be done.
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An unencrypted PEM encoded certificate/key may be supplied by using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-key\fP must contain at most one private key, the key can be in one of the following formats:
\- PKCS#1
\- PKCS#8
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "PEM ENCODED CERTIFICATE/PEM OR DER ENCRYPTED PKCS#8 KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#8 formatted key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-key\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate, and an optional chain required to authenticate
the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SS "ENCRYPTED PKCS#12 CERTIFICATE/KEY"
.sp
An encrypted PKCS#12 certificate/key may be provided using:
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert <path>\fP
\- \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\-password <password>\fP
.sp
The file passed to \f(CR\-\-client\-cert\fP must contain the client certificate and exactly one private key. It may also contain
the chain required to authenticate the client certificate.
.sp
Currently, only the following key types are supported:
\- RSA
\- DSA
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To create a new remote reference to a Couchbase cluster named "east" run the
following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If the new remote reference should always be encrypted then make sure to enable
encryption.

.fam C
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs

To list all current XDCR cluster references run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs

If you need to edit a cluster references named "east" and change the password
run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-edit \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east \-\-xdcr\-hostname 192.168.1.6
 \-\-xdcr\-username Administrator \-\-xdcr\-password new_password
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note in the above example that you need to specify all of the current unchanging
configuration parameters also to avoid them being reset to defaults.
.sp
If you no longer need an XDCR remote reference then you can delete it. We should
this below using the "east" remote reference as an example.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.fam C
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs

.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
