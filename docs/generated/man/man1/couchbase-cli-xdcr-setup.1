.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to manage the remote clusters that are available to be
replicated to.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specfies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-create
.RS 4
Creates an new XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-delete
.RS 4
Deletes an XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-edit
.RS 4
Edits an XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-list
.RS 4
List all XDCR remote references.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name <name>
.RS 4
The name for the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-hostname <hostname>
.RS 4
The hostname of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-username <username>
.RS 4
The username of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-demand\-encryption <num>
.RS 4
Enable SSL when replicating with this cluster. To enable SSL set the value
of this otion to 1. To disable SSL then set this option to 0. BY default the
value of this option is set to 0.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-encryption\-type <type>
.RS 4
Specifes the type of encryption to use if encryption is enabled. This flag
may either be set to "half" encryption or "full encryption". Half encryption
means that passwords are encrypted, but data is not. This results in faster
data transfer, but less security. Full encryption means that all data and
passwords are encrypted which increases security, but reduces overall data
transfer speed. This flag does not have any affect if encryption is not
enabled. If encryption is enabled and this flag is set then the value
defaults to full encryption.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-certificate <file>
.RS 4
The path to the certificate used for encryption.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To create a new remote reference to a Couchbase cluster named "east" run the
following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-create \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east \-\-xdcr\-hostname 192.168.1.6
 \-\-xdcr\-username Administrator \-\-xdcr\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If the new remote reference should always be encrypted then make sure to enable
encryption.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-create \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east \-\-xdcr\-hostname 192.168.1.6 \(rs
 \-\-xdcr\-username Administrator \-\-xdcr\-password password \(rs
 \-\-xdcr\-demand\-encryption 1 \-\-xdcr\-certificate /root/cluster.cert
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To list all current XDCR cluster references run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-list
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If you need to edit a cluster references named "east" and change the password
run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-edit \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east \-\-xdcr\-hostname 192.168.1.6
 \-\-xdcr\-username Administrator \-\-xdcr\-password new_password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note in the above example that you need to specify all of the current unchanging
configuration parameters also to avoid them being reset to defaults.
.sp
If you no longer need an XDCR remote reference then you can delete it. We should
this below using the "east" remote reference as an exmaple.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-delete \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line.
