.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command is used to manage the remote clusters that are available to be
replicated to.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specifies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-create
.RS 4
Creates an new XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-delete
.RS 4
Deletes an XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-edit
.RS 4
Edits an XDCR remote reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-list
.RS 4
List all XDCR remote references.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name <name>
.RS 4
The name for the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-hostname <hostname>
.RS 4
The hostname of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-username <username>
.RS 4
The username of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-password <password>
.RS 4
The password of the remote cluster reference.
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-user\-certificate <path>
.RS 4
The user certificate for authentication
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-user\-key <path>
.RS 4
The user key for authentication
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-certificate <path>
.RS 4
The certificate used for encryption
.RE
.sp
\-\-xdcr\-secure\-connection <type>
.RS 4
Specifies the type of encryption to use. This flag may either be set to
  either "half", "full", or "none". Half encryption means that passwords are
  encrypted, but data is not. This results in faster data transfer, but less
  security. Full encryption means that all data and passwords are encrypted
  which increases security, but reduces overall data transfer speed. If no
  encryption is needed then "none" can be specified. This flag defaults to
  "none" if it is not specified.

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To create a new remote reference to a Couchbase cluster named "east" run the
following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-create \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east \-\-xdcr\-hostname 192.168.1.6
 \-\-xdcr\-username Administrator \-\-xdcr\-password password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If the new remote reference should always be encrypted then make sure to enable
encryption.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-create \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east \-\-xdcr\-hostname 192.168.1.6 \(rs
 \-\-xdcr\-username Administrator \-\-xdcr\-password password \(rs
 \-\-xdcr\-demand\-encryption 1 \-\-xdcr\-certificate /root/cluster.cert
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To list all current XDCR cluster references run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-list
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If you need to edit a cluster references named "east" and change the password
run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-edit \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east \-\-xdcr\-hostname 192.168.1.6
 \-\-xdcr\-username Administrator \-\-xdcr\-password new_password
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note in the above example that you need to specify all of the current unchanging
configuration parameters also to avoid them being reset to defaults.
.sp
If you no longer need an XDCR remote reference then you can delete it. We should
this below using the "east" remote reference as an exmaple.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli xdcr\-setup \-c 192.168.1.5 \-u Administrator \(rs
 \-p password \-\-delete \-\-xdcr\-cluster\-name east
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_USERNAME
.RS 4
Specifies the username to use when executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-u/\-\-username
argument on the command line.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
