.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command sets gloabl default settings for all XDCR replications. If you only
want to change the settings for a single XDCR replication see the
\fBcouchbase\-cli\-xdcr\-replicate\fP(1) command.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specfies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-checkpoint\-interval <seconds>
.RS 4
The interval between checkpoints in seconds. The value of this option must
be between 60 and 14,400.
.RE
.sp
\-\-worker\-batch\-size <num>
.RS 4
The worker batch size. The value of this option must be between 500 and
10,000.
.RE
.sp
\-\-doc\-batch\-size <kilobytes>
.RS 4
The document batch size in Kilobytes. The value of this option must be
between 10 and 100,000.
.RE
.sp
\-\-failure\-restart\-interval <seconds>
.RS 4
Interval for restarting failed XDCR connections in seconds. The value of
this option must be between 1 and 300.
.RE
.sp
\-\-optimistic\-replication\-threshold <bytes>
.RS 4
Document body size threshold in bytes used to trigger optimistic
replication.
.RE
.sp
\-\-source\-nozzle\-per\-node <num>
.RS 4
The number of source nozzles to each node in the target cluster. The
value of this option must be between 1 and 10.
.RE
.sp
\-\-target\-nozzle\-per\-node <num>
.RS 4
The number of outgoing nozzles to each node in the target cluster. The
value of this option must be between 1 and 10.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bandwidth\-usage\-limit <num>
.RS 4
The default bandwidth limit for XDCR replications in Megabytes per second.
.RE
.sp
\-\-log\-level <level>
.RS 4
The XDCR log level.
.RE
.sp
\-\-stats\-interval <milliseconds>
.RS 4
The interval for statistics updates in milliseconds.

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
If we want to change the checkpoint interval to 500 seconds, the worker batch to
1000 documents, the document batch size to 10240KB, the failure restart interval
to 60 seconds. the optimistic replication threshold to 102400 bytes, the source
nozzels to 8, the target nozzles to 8, the log level to info, and the stats
interval to 100 milliseconds run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line. It also allows the user to ensure that their
password are not cached in their command line history.
.RE
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. This environment
variable allows you to specify a default argument for the \-p/\-\-password
argument on the command line.
