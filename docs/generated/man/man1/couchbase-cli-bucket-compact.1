.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Starts compaction of view index and data files for a specified bucket. To
compact view index files only, specify the \-\-view\-only option. To compact data
files only, specify the \-\-data\-only option. Only Couchbase buckets can be
compacted: Ephemeral and Memcached buckets cannot be compacted.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specfies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket
.RS 4
The name of the bucket on which to perform compaction.
.RE
.sp
\-\-data\-only
.RS 4
Indicates that only data files should be compacted, and that compaction
for view index files should therefore be skipped. This option cannot be
specified at the same time as the \-\-view\-only option.
.RE
.sp
\-\-view\-only
.RS 4
Indicates that only view index files should be compacted, and that
compaction for data files should therefore be skipped. This option cannot be
specified at the same time as the \-\-data\-only option.

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To start compaction of both data and view index files for a bucket named
"travel\-data", run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli bucket\-compact \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-bucket travel\-data
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
If view index files only should be compacted for a specific bucket, and
data files thereby skipped, run the following command.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli bucket\-compact \-c 192.168.1.5:8091 \-\-username Administrator \(rs
 \-\-password password \-\-bucket travel\-data \-\-view\-only
.fi
.if n .RE

.SH "ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.sp
CB_REST_PASSWORD
