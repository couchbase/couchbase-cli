.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Creates a new bucket. Allows creation of Couchbase, Ephemeral, and Memcached
buckets, and supports the various configuration parameters for these
buckets.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-c, \-\-cluster
.RS 4
Specfies the hostname of a node in the cluster. See the HOST FORMATS
section for more information on specifying a hostname.
.RE
.sp
\-u, \-\-user <username>
.RS 4
Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error.
.RE
.sp
\-p, \-\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
a user account with permision to execute the command then it will fail with
an unauthorized error. If this argument is specified, but no password is
given then the command will prompt the user for a password through
non\-echoed stdin. You may also specify your password by using the
environment variable CB_REST_PASSWORD.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket <name>
.RS 4
The name of the bucket to create. The only characters that can be used
for the bucket\-name are those in the ranges of A\-Z, a\-z, and 0\-9; plus the
underscore, period, dash, and percent characters. The name can be a
maximum of 100 characters in length.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-type <type>
.RS 4
The type of bucket to create. Accepted bucket types are "couchbase",
"ephemeral", and "memcached". The Couchbase bucket is the standard bucket
type. It supports data persistence, replication, caching, indexing, views,
and N1QL queries. The Ephemeral bucket is an in\-memory bucket similar to the
Couchbase bucket; but it does not support data persistence or views. The
Memcached bucket is a cache\-only bucket that does not support persistence,
replication, indexing, views, or N1QL querying: this bucket type provides
the same behavior as Memcached Server.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-ramsize <size>
.RS 4
The amount of memory to allocate to the cache for this bucket, in Megabytes.
The memory quota of this bucket must fit into the overall cluster memory
quota. The minimum cache size is 100MB.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-replica <num>
.RS 4
The number of servers to which data is replicated. Replicas provide
protection against data loss by keeping copies of this bucket\(cqs data on
multiple servers. By default, the number of replicas is one, even if there
is only a single server in the cluster. The minimum number of replicas is
zero, and the maximum three. This option is valid for Couchbase and
Ephemeral buckets only.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-port <num>
.RS 4
Sets the port on which the bucket listens. This parameter is deprecated, and
therefore not recommended for use.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-priority <priority>
.RS 4
Specifies the priority of this bucket\(cqs background tasks. This option is
valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only. For Couchbase buckets,
background task\-types include disk I/O, DCP stream\-processing, and
item\-paging. For Ephemeral buckets, background task\-types are the same as
for Couchbase buckets, with the exception of disk I/O, which does not apply
to Ephemeral buckets. The value of this option may be "high" or "low". The
default is "low". Specifying "high" may result in faster processing; but
only when more than one bucket is defined for the cluster, and when
different priority settings have been established among the buckets. When
Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets have different priority settings, this
affects the prioritization only of task\-types other than disk I/O.
.RE
.sp
\-\-bucket\-eviction\-policy <policy>
.RS 4
The memory\-cache eviction policy for this bucket. This option is valid for
Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only.
.sp
Couchbase buckets support either "valueOnly" or "fullEviction". Specifying
the "valueOnly" policy means that each key stored in this bucket must be
kept in memory. This is the default policy: using this policy improves
performance of key\-value operations, but limits the maximum size of the
bucket. Specifying the "fullEviction" policy means that performance is
impacted for key\-value operations, but the maximum size of the bucket is
unbounded.
.sp
Ephemeral buckets support either "noEviction" or "nruEviction". Specifying
"noEviction" means that the bucket will not evict items from the cache if
the cache is full: this type of eviction policy should be used for in\-memory
database use\-cases. Specifying "nruEviction" means that items not recently
used will be evicted from memory, when all memory in the bucket is used:
this type of eviction policy should be used for caching use\-cases.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-flush <num>
.RS 4
Specifies whether or not the flush operation is allowed for this bucket. To
enable flushing, set this option to "1". To disable flushing, set this
option to "0". By default, flushing is disabled.
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-index\-replica <num>
.RS 4
Enables view index replication for the current bucket. This option is valid
for Couchbase buckets only. To enable, set the value of this option to "1".
To disable, set the value of this option to "0". By default, view index
replication is disabled. There may be at most one replica view index.
.RE
.sp
\-\-conflict\-resolution <type>
.RS 4
Specifies this bucket\(cqs conflict resolution mechanism; which is to be used
if a conflict occurs during Cross Data\-Center Replication (XDCR).
Sequence\-based and timestamp\-based mechanisms are supported.
.sp
Sequence\-based conflict resolution selects the document that has been
updated the greatest number of times since the last sync: for example, if
one cluster has updated a document twice since the last sync, and the other
cluster has updated the document three times, the document updated three
times is selected; regardless of the specific times at which updates took
  place.
.sp
Timestamp\-based conflict resolution selects the document with the most
recent timestamp: this is only supported when all clocks on all
cluster\-nodes have been fully synchronized.
.RE
.sp
\-\-wait
.RS 4
The create bucket command is asynchronous by default. Specifying this option
makes the operation synchronous: so that the command returns only after the
bucket has been fully created.
.RE
.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}

.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\

\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
