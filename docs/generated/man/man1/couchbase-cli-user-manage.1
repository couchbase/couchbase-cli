.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This command allows administrators to assign and manage roles to different users
in their organization. Users can either be managed locally by Couchbase or
externally through the use of an external domain.
.SH "OPTIONS"

deleting, creating, or updating an RBAC user profile.
.RE
.sp
\-\-rbac\-password <password>
.RS 4
Specifies the password to be used for an RBAC user profile. This option is

\-\-roles <roles_list>
.RS 4
Specifies the roles to be given to an RBAC user profile. This option is used

Specifies the auth_domain to used for an RBAC user profile. This option is
used when deleting, creating or updating an RBAC user profile and it if may

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
