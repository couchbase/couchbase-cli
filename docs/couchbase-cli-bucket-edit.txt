couchbase-cli-bucket-edit - Edit a bucket


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli bucket-edit' [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
	  [--password <password>] [--bucket <name>] [--bucket-ramsize <size>]
	  [--bucket-replica <num>] [--bucket-priority <priority>]
	  [--bucket-eviction-policy <policy>] [--enable-flush <num>]
	  [--max-ttl <seconds>] [--compression-mode <mode>]
	  [--remove-bucket-port <num>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Modifies the settings of the bucket specified. Note that some settings can be
applied immediately, while other settings either require a rebalance, or require
the bucket to be restarted; resulting in potential application downtime.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--bucket <name>::
	The name of the bucket to edit.

--bucket-ramsize <size>::
	The amount of memory to allocate to the cache for this bucket, in Megabytes.
	The memory quota of this bucket must fit into the overall cluster memory
	quota. The minimum cache size is 100MB.

--bucket-replica <num>::
	The number of servers to which data is replicated. Replicas provide
	protection against data loss by keeping copies of a bucket's data on
	multiple servers. By default, the number of replicas is one, even if there is
	only a single server in the cluster. The minimum number of replicas is zero,
	and the maximum three. This option is valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral
	buckets only.

--bucket-port <num>::
	Sets the port on which the bucket listens. This parameter is deprecated, and
	therefore not recommended for use.

--bucket-priority <priority>::
	Specifies the priority of this bucket's background tasks. This option is
	valid for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only. For Couchbase buckets,
	background task-types include disk I/O, DCP stream-processing, and
	item-paging. For Ephemeral buckets, background task-types are the same as
	for Couchbase buckets, with the exception of disk I/O, which does not apply
	to Ephemeral buckets. The value of this option may be "high" or "low". The
	default is "low". Specifying "high" may result in faster processing; but
	only when more than one bucket is defined for the cluster, and when
	different priority settings have been established among the buckets. When
	Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets have different priority settings, this
	affects the prioritization only of task-types other than disk I/O.

--bucket-eviction-policy <policy>::
	The memory-cache eviction policy for this bucket. This option is valid for
	Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets only.
+
[normal]
	Couchbase buckets support either "valueOnly" or "fullEviction". Specifying
	the "valueOnly" policy means that each key stored in this bucket must be
	kept in memory. This is the default policy: using this policy improves
	performance of key-value operations, but limits the maximum size of the
	bucket. Specifying the "fullEviction" policy means that performance is
	impacted for key-value operations, but the maximum size of the bucket is
	unbounded.
+
[normal]
	Ephemeral buckets support either "noEviction" or "nruEviction". Specifying
	"noEviction" means that the bucket will not evict items from the cache if
	the cache is full: this type of eviction policy should be used for in-memory
	database use-cases. Specifying "nruEviction" means that items not recently
	used will be evicted from memory, when all memory in the bucket is used:
	this type of eviction policy should be used for caching use-cases.

--enable-flush <num>::
	Specifies whether or not the flush operation is allowed for this bucket. To
	enable flushing, set this option to "1". To disable flushing, set this
	option to "0". By default, flushing is disabled.

--enable-index-replica <num>::
	Enables view index replication for the current bucket. This option is valid
	for Couchbase buckets only. To enable, set the value of this option to "1".
	To disable, set the value of this option to "0". By default, view index
	replication is disabled. There may be at most one replica view index.

--max-ttl <seconds>::
	Specifies the maximum TTL (time-to-live) for all documents in
	bucket in seconds. If enabled and a document is mutated with no TTL
	or a TTL greater than than the maximum, its TTL will be set to the
	maximum TTL. Setting this option to 0 disables the use of max-TTL
	and the largest TTL that is allowed is 2147483647. This option is
	only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase
	Enterprise Edition.

--compression-mode <mode>::
	Specifies the compression-mode of the bucket. There are three options;
	off, passive and active. All three modes are backwards compatible with
	older SDKs, where Couchbase Server will automatically uncompress documents
	for clients that do not understand the compression being used. This option
	is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase
	Enterprise Edition.
+
[normal]
	Off: Couchbase Server will only compress document values when persisting to
	disk. This is suitable for use cases where compression could have a
	negative impact on performance. Please note it is expected that compression
	in most use cases will improve performance.
+
[normal]
	Passive: Documents which were compressed by a client, or read compressed
	from disk will be stored compress in-memory. Couchbase Server will make
	no additional attempt to compress documents that are not already compressed.
+
[normal]
	Active: Couchbase Server will actively and aggressively attempt to compress
	documents, even if they have not been received in a compressed format. This
	provides the benefits of compression even when the SDK clients are not
	complicit.

--remove-bucket-port <num>::
	Removes the bucket-port setting that might have been set in previous
	versions of Couchbase Server. The bucket-port also knows as the dedicated
	port and server side moxi has been deprecated. In later versions of
	Couchbase Server a cluster will not be able to upgrade if a bucket has the
	dedicated port set. This option allows removal of that setting by setting
	it to 1.

EXAMPLES
--------

To change the memory quota of the travel-data bucket, run the following
command:

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-edit -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --bucket travel-data --bucket-ramsize 1024

To change the number of replicas for the travel-data bucket to "2", run the
following command. (Note that this requires a subsequent rebalance, by means of
linkcbdoc:couchbase-cli-rebalance[1], to ensure that the replicas are created.)

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-edit -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --bucket travel-data --bucket-ramsize 1024 \
	 --bucket-replicas 2

To remove the bucket-port from the test bucket

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-edit -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --bucket test --remove-bucket-port 1
