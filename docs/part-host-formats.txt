HOST FORMATS
------------

When specifying a host for the couchbase-cli command the following formats are expected:

* `couchbase://<addr>`
* `<addr>:<port>`
* `http://<addr>:<port>`


It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
