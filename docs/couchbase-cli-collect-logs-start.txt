SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli collect-logs-start' [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
	  [--password <password>] [--all-nodes] [--nodes <node_list>]
	  [--redaction-level] [--salt <string>] [--output-directory]
	  [--temporary-directory] [--upload] [--upload-host <host>]
	  [--upload-proxy <host>] [--customer <customer>] [--ticket <ticket>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command collects all Couchbase Server log files from one or more nodes in
the cluster. Log collection is useful when there are failures in the cluster and
you need to figure out what is going on. Since there are many log files on
various different server the collect-logs-start command helps in aggregating all
of the different log file Couchbase Server creates.

To get the location of the collected log files you can run the
linkcbdoc:collect-logs-status[1] command either while the log collection task
is running or after the log collection task has completed. If the --upload flag
is specified then the logs will also be uploaded to the host specified in the
--upload-host flag. The upload flag is intended for Couchbase Server
Enterprise Edition users who need to upload logs to the Couchbase Support Team
to aid in diagnosing support tickets that they have filed.

Note that only one log collection task may be running at any given time in the
cluster.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--all-nodes::
	Specifies that log collection should take place on all nodes in the cluster.
	May not be specified at the same time as --nodes.

--nodes <node_list>::
	A list of one or more nodes to collect logs from, the nodes must include the
	administrator port. The list should be comma
	separated. This parameter may not be specified at the same time as the
	--nodes option.

--redaction-level <level>::
	Specifies what level the logs should be redacted too. This option has two
	levels "none" and "partial". If partial is set then data such as
	usernames, keys and values will be redacted from the logs. If none is set
	then no data  will be redacted. Please note that increasing the level
	of redaction can have an impact on debugging problems.

--salt <string>::
	Specifies the string to used as the salt. This option can only be used
	when --redaction-level is set to "partial". The salt is used to increase
	the security of the redacted log files. If the option is not specified
	then a salt is generated each time the logs are collected. It is important
	to specify the salt if logs are from multiple collections or logs from client
	SDKs have to be cross referenced against each other.

--output-directory <directory>::
	Specifies the directory on the node to place the logs. This is the location
	where the logs will be placed after collection has finished. Log collection
	will fail for the nodes that do not have this directory. It will also fail
	if the directory does not have enough space.

--temporary-directory <path>::
	Specifies the temporary directory on the node to use while generating the
	logs. During log collection a number of temporary files are created before
	being compressed. If this temporary location does not have enough space
	log collection will fail. All nodes in the cluster must have this
	directory. When it is not specified then the operating system temporary
	directory will be used.

--upload::
	Specifies that the logs should be uploaded to the host specified with
	the --upload-host option. This option should be used by Couchbase Server
	Enterprise customers when uploading logs for the Couchbase Support Team.

--upload-proxy <host>::
	Specifies the proxy to use when uploading logs. This is useful when a
	cluster is deployed in secure environments and do not have a direct
	outbound connection to the internet to upload logs.

--upload-host <host>::
	Once log collection is completed, the logs zip file should be uploaded to
	this URL. This parameter is required if the --upload flag is specified.

--customer <name>::
	The name of the customer who is uploading these logs. This option is
	required if the --upload flag is specified.

--ticket <num>::
	The ticket number that the support team has created to track the issue
	filed. This parameter is optional when specifying the --upload flag, but
	recommended if you have a ticket number.

EXAMPLES
--------

To collect logs on all nodes without uploading them run the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --all-nodes

If there is a three node cluster with IP addresses 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, and
192.168.1.7 and you only want to collect logs on the first two nodes and don't
want to upload the logs then run the command below.

	$ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --nodes 192.168.1.5:8091,192.168.1.6:8091

If you are a Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition user and you need to upload logs
for all nodes for a support ticket then you can run the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --all-nodes --upload --upload-customer customer_name \
	 --upload-host s3.amazonaws.com/cb-customers --ticket 12345
