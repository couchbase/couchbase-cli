-s::
--ssl::
	(Deprecated) Specifies that the connection should use SSL verification. If
	this flag is used then SSL will be used but the cluster certificate will not
	be verified by the Certificate Authority. This flag is deprecated and not
	recommended. If you wish to use SSL encryption it is recommended that you
	specify the cluster host name using either 'couchbases://' or 'https://'.
	Each of these connection schemes will ensure that the connection is
	encrypted with SSL. You may then use either --no-ssl-verify or --cacert in
	order to customize how your SSL connection is set up.

--no-ssl-verify::
	Specfies that SSL verification should be used but that verifying that the
	cluster certificate is valid should be skipped. Use of this flag is not
	recommended for production environments because it does not protect the user
	from a man-in-the-middle attack.

--cacert::
	Specifies that the SSL connection should use the cacert provided when
	connecting to the cluster. This argument takes the path the certificate
	file as its value. This is the most secure way to connect to your cluster.
