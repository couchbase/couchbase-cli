couchbase-cli-server-readd(1)
=============================

NAME
----
couchbase-cli-server-readd - Adds a node back to the cluster after a failover

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli server-readd' [--cluster <url>] [--username <username>]
	  [--password <password>] [--server-add <servers>] [--group-name <name>]
	  [--server-username <username>] [--server-password <password>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

DEPRECATED: This command was deprecated in 5.0.0 and will be removed in future
releases. Please use the linkcbdoc:couchbase-cli-recovery[1] subcommand which
provides similar functionality to this command.

The server-readd subcommand is used to add a server back to the cluster. This
operation is useful after a node is failed over and also when a node is
removed from the cluster for maintainance.

When a node is failed over and removed from the cluster it may be able to
be added back to the cluster. An example of this is when a node loses power.
This node might get failed over and removed from the cluster, but once power
is restored to the node you may want to add it back to the cluster.

Another use case is taking a node out of the cluster for maintainance. This
is done by gracefully failing over a node to ensure there is no data loss.
The administrator can then perform maintenance on the removed node and add it
back with the server-readd command.

It is also possible to add a server back to the cluster without removing the
data and instead having the server recover data from where it left off. This is
called delta recovery and is available from the
linkcbdoc:couchbase-cli-recovery[1] subcommand.

Note that after the server-readd subcommand is run you must rebalance the
cluster. See the linkcbdoc:couchbase-cli-rebalance[1] command for more
information on rebalancing a cluster.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--server-add <servers>::
	A comma separated list of nodes to readd. The each server should
	correspond to the hostname or IP address of a server to be added back to
	the cluster.

--server-username <username>::
	Adding a node back to the cluster can only be done by a user with the
	appropriate credentials. This flag specifies the username for a user who
	has the ability to modify the cluster topology of the node being added
	back.

--server-password <password>::
	Adding a node back to the cluster can only be done by a user with the
	appropriate credentials. This flag specifies the password for a user who
	has the ability to modify the cluster topology of the node being added
	back.

--group-name <name>::
	The name of the group to add the node to.

EXAMPLES
--------

If there is a node at 192.168.1.6:8091 that you want to add back and that
node has credentials that allow us to change the cluster topology with
"Administrator" as the username and "password" as the password, run the
following command.

	$ couchbase-cli server-readd -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --server-readd 192.168.1.6:8091 \
	 --server-username Administrator --server-password password

If you need to add back multiple nodes then you would run the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli server-readd -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --server-readd 192.168.1.6:8091,192.168.1.7:8091 \
	 --server-username Administrator --server-password password

If you wanted the nodes being added back to the cluster to be a part of the
"East" group we would run the following command

	$ couchbase-cli server-readd -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --server-readd 192.168.1.6:8091 --group-name East \
	 --server-username Administrator --server-password password
