couchbase-cli-failover(1)
=========================

NAME
----
couchbase-cli-failover - Failover a node in the cluster


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli failover' [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
	  [--password <password>][--server-failover <server_list>] [--force]
	  [--no-progress-bar] [--no-wait]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command fails over one or more nodes. Nodes can be either hard failed
over or gracefully failed over. A hard failover means that the failover happens
immediately, but risks potential data loss. Graceful failover ensures that
replication is up to date before the node is failed over so that there is no
data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note that if a node is already down
you must perform a hard failover.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--server-failover <server_list>::
	A comma separated list of nodes to failover.

--force::
	Specifying this flag signifies that the nodes to be failed over should be
	hard failed over. A hard failover means that the failover is immediate, but
	you risk potential data loss. If this flag is not specified then the
	failover will occur only once replication is up to date. This means there
	will be no data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note that if a
	server is already down you must hard fail it over.

--no-progress-bar::
	Disables showing the progress bar which tracks the progress of the
	rebalance. Note that a rebalance only occurs for graceful failovers (e.g.
	non-forced failovers). The failover command will still wait for rebalance
	completion even if this flag is specified, but the progress bar will not
	be shown.

--no-wait::
	Specifies that this command should not wait for the completion of rebalance
	before exiting. Note that a rebalance only occurs for graceful failovers
	(eg. non-forced failovers).

To hard fail over a node run the following command:

	$ couchbase-cli failover -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \

To gracefully failover a node run the following command:
