= Couchbase Command Line Tools

This package contains the command line tool set that performs the same
actions to provide the user the same capabilities as the Couchbase
Server web interface.

== Prerequisites

If you have installed the full Couchbase Server, these tools will have
all prerequisites required to run these tools. If you run these tools
standalone, you will need:

* Python 2.6 or greater
* Command shell such as bash

== Building the Documentation

The documentation for this tool set is stored in link:docs[]. The source
documents, which can be found in link:docs/modules/cli/pages/cbcli[], are
written in AsciiDoc and used to produce HTML and man page files.

NOTE: The docs folder structure is deeply nested in order for these documents to be
incorporated directly into the main documentation for Couchbase Server hosted
at https://docs.couchbase.com.

You can use the link:docs/generate.sh[generate.sh] script to generate
standalone HTML and man page versions of these source documents. The list of
files to convert is maintained in the script itself. When run, the script
writes the generated documents to the link:docs/generated[generated] folder.
Under the current workflow, this folder needs to be committed back to the
repository for other tools to consume.

The generate.sh script requires the *asciidoctor* command to be available on
your machine (which in turn requires Ruby). Installation of this software is
covered in the next section.

=== macOS Requirements

 $ brew install asciidoctor
